We've prepared for this, doctor. Harnessing energy from space. That can be harmful. Where's Barton? Agent Barton, report. BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They both walk around the facility in a discreet manner. I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things. Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off? At this end? Sir, please put down the spear! Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss Loki's fired shot. ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him. In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost gone to shit. Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.  We have no quarrel with your people. You planning to step on us? Free from what? Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing. From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion. Like The Pharaohs of Odin. (through the walkie talkie) Hill, do you copy?! Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill. Barton is... He's got the Tesseract! Track it down! The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling. The Tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill? Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case. Coulson, get back to base. This is a LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at war. A beat. You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control? Not Asgard. Loki. Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us. PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team. This isn't about The Avengers. I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need. No, it's won by soldiers. Trouble sleeping? Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down. We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently. I am. Trying to save it. Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on HYDRA'S projects. Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs. He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know. Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment. Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of the gym. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now? Good. Let's vanish. Gentlemen. Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it. Doctor, thank you for coming. Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear. How many are there? Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please. Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall. Captain, you're up. Steve nods. Leaves. (V.O.) Said anything? (V.O.) Just get him here. We're low on time. With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering. In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass. Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though. Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?! Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki. Ant. Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap. Boot. Built for something a lot stronger than you. How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control. (CONT'D) You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.   I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. (O.S.) War hasn't started yet. A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops. I'm asking. What are you prepared to do? Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? Thor doesn't answer.  You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract. (trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're... Because of him. (pointing at Thor) Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned. But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled. You forced our hand. We had to come up with something. Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark? Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up? You need to step away. Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr.Banner back to his... The cell was just in case... Hill?! Stark! You copy that?! Coulson! Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! Move out! Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water. Is the sun coming up?! Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop. We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE appears. Get his attention. They are not getting through here, so what the hell... Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB It's Barton. He took out our systems. He's headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy? (V.O.) Stark, we're losing altitude. Just stay awake. EYES ON ME! Not an option. (V.O.) Agent Coulson is down. Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up. (V.O.) They're here. (V.O.) They called it. These were in Phil Coulson's jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD. We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming. Well, it's an old fashioned notion. Agent Hill? They needed the push. (holding Coulson's cards) A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying off as well as the QUINJET. They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything. I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision, I've elected to ignore it. That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. Until I'm certain my team can't hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population. I send that bird out, we already have. Fury shuts off his viewscreen. RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG- 7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED. Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there, knowing he can't do anything about it. Stark, you hearing me? We have a missile headed straight for the city. Three minutes, at best. Stay low and wipe out the missile. I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a leave of absence. The Tesseract is where it belongs: out of our reach. I didn't make it. I just didn't argue with the god that did. Oh, I think he will be. They surely are. And the whole world knows it. Every world knows it. A promise. They'll come back. I am. Because we'll need them to.\",\n",

COULSON He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement. COULSON Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac.

COULSON COULSON COULSON You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby. HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her back. COULSON We need you to come in. COULSON This takes precedence. COULSON Natasha. Barton's been compromised. A beat. COULSON We don't know. COULSON We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy. COULSON No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy. COULSON Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up his phone and looks into it at Coulson. COULSON This is urgent. COULSON Mr. Stark. COULSON We need you to look this over. (he holds out a file towards COULSON This isn't a consultation. COULSON This isn't about personality profiles anymore. COULSON A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula. The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart. COULSON Not so much. When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking. Steve looks confused. COULSON He's like a smart person. I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially. Steve smiles at Coulson. COULSON I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to the side with Coulson following. COULSON I mean, I was... I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it's really, it's just a... just a huge honor to have you on board. COULSON Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input. COULSON With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned. Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment. COULSON Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers. COULSON See you there. Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking towards the railing of the ship. COULSON We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us. COULSON I mean, if it's not too much trouble. COULSON It's a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but... COULSON Location? COULSON As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster. We've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She'll be safe. COULSON He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here. COULSON Like what? COULSON Don't think so. COULSON Move away, please. Loki moves away from the switch. COULSON You like this? We started working on the prototype after you sent THE DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it does. Do you wanna find out? COULSON You're gonna lose. COULSON It's in your nature. COULSON You lack conviction. COULSON So that's what it does. COULSON Sorry, boss. They got rabbited. COULSON No. I'm clocked out here. COULSON It's okay, boss. This was never going to work... if they didn't have something... to... Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.\",\n",

If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level... We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she's throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation. The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual. We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his earpiece. Loki? Brother of Thor? He's right.

Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides. DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends of the facility. The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL. A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding everyone. The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform. SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI. Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter. Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. (pointing to the Loki team) Need these vehicles. He didn't tell me. Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck and turns to leave, as she's walking away... SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM. Is this the stuff you need? Especially if SHIELD knows you need it. My next target. I'll need a distraction. (grabs his bow) And an eyeball. You know that? Is that what you know? I got...I gotta go in though. I gotta flush him out. I don't understand.

Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose. But you don't. You're a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you? Natasha. I can.

As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract, placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then... Please don't. I still need that. Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose. An ant has no quarrel with a boot. I come with glad tidings, of a world made free. Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart... Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart. Selvig's eyes glow BLACK. You will know peace. Well, then... Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND.

I will lead them into glorious battle. Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim. I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed! You don't have the Tesseract yet. THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter. I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton? Tell me what you need. Kneel before me. The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd. Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their spears, encircling the crowd. I said. KNEEL!!! Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing his arms out, smiling. Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel. As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN refuses to kneel and stands, heroic. There are no men like me. Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.  Kneel. I'm not overly fond of what follows. What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet. Not a light. A King. THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony puts the IRON MAN helmet on.  Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth. Thor drops MJï¿½LNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up Loki. His brother. Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god. Did you mourn? Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them.   Well, yes. I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it... I am a king! I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where. Mjï¿½lnir flies back to his grasp. I'm listening.  Oh, I've heard. Loki looks into the camera. The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you? Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is. There's not many people that can sneak up on me. (turns to see NATASHA After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate.

What have I to fear? Yes, I've met them. That was the plan. I have an army. I thought the beast had wandered off. (slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you? Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing. Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING. It should work. You will all fall before me. LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower. From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out. The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit. It LATCHES onto Tony.

Loki fires ENERGY from the scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor. he TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly, the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT. With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them. hey look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people. hor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch the city falling to ash. he TRIO runs behind upside taxis.

Thor nods to Cap. he Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled, to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case. Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it. The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE. Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley.

Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki. oki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to the entrance of the gala. oki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS. Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain. oki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control panel of the cell. oki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he stops. oki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH. oki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send Thor as well. oki looks up, smiling mischievously. oki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE. oki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the steps, towards the bar. oki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER. Loki turns to his ENEMY. oki watches below, motionless. oki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag doll. He takes a few breathers, senses someone is behind him. He turns TO FIND THE AVENGERS STARING AT HIM, PISSED.\",\n",

We\\'ve kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent. Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in. I\\'ll persuade you. You\\'ve been more than a year without an incident. I don\\'t think you wanna break that streak. Doctor, we\\'re facing a potential global catastrophe. This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet. She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner takes a closer look. Well, he wants you to find it. It\\'s been taken. It emits a gamma signature that\\'s too weak for us to trace. There\\'s no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that\\'s where I\\'d be. Not that he\\'s told me. Talk to Fury, he needs you on this. No one\\'s gonna put you in a... Stand down. We\\'re good here. Hi. There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? They\\'re vintage, he\\'s very proud. Without realizing, Banner doesn\\'t notice them walking as he isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in hisway. Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. It\\'s gonna get a little hard to breath. Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly \"sail.\" That\\'s still not gonna find them in time. You\\'re gonna love it, Doc.

Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter\\'s tip on his helmet. The guy\\'s all over the place. Suddenly, AC/DC\\'s \"Shoot to Thrill\" overdrives the QUINJET\\'S speakers. Not a word. Where\\'s this coming from? Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently. Another Asgardian? I\\'d sit this one out, Cap. These guys come from legends, they\\'re basically gods. Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours. He killed eighty people in two days. But you figured I\\'d come. I wanna know what you\\'ve done to Agent Barton. And once you\\'ve won. Once you\\'re king of the mountain. What happens to his mind? Love is for children. I owe him a debt. (she pulls up a chair as Not let you out. Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that, I\\'m Russian... or was. It\\'s really not that complicated.

Loki\\'s manipulating you. You didn\\'t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you. (CONT\\'D) (quietly, to herself) I\\'m okay. We\\'re okay, right? Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We\\'re gonna be okay. Listen to me. Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.

Well, those I actively try to avoid. What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it? So Fury isn't after the monster? And he tells you everything? He needs me in a cage?  I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha... Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece. Just you and me? Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down. Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming. Is that the only word on me? (takes in the sentiment) Must be strange for you, all of this. Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container? They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE  Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying? Where are you with that? Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen. You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to? Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? He really grows on you, doesn't he? So he's building another portal. That's what he needs Erik Selvig for. He's an astrophysicist. I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him. Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for? He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.  Let's play some. As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing. The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process. All I packed was a tooth brush. Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.  No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things. (bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and... 'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube. (pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news. It's powered by Stark Reactors, self- sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year? (referring to Tony) So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place? Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off. The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us. And I'll read all about it. Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare. But you can control it. It's different. Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face. So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life? (CONT'D) That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what? You might not like that. We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile. Did you know about this? I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed. And you've been doing what exactly? Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction. It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're... we're a time-bomb. Yeah, this is a tee... Where? You rented my room. In case you needed to kill me, but you can't! I know! I tried! You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm? BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.

It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon. I do! I understood that reference. Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.  Is everything a joke to you? Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny. No offense, doctor. And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark. You think Fury's hiding something? Doctor? A beat. I heard it. The Stark Tower? That big ugly (Tony gives him a look) ...building in New York? (taken by that) I'm sorry, did you say...? Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around? I think Loki's trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them.  Just find the cube.

Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS Tomorrow. Well, what if I didn't? Yeah. Square deal. It's the last date. Pepper kisses him. What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjï¿½lnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree. Okay. From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mjï¿½lnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch! Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjï¿½lnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back. How about that? IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up. It's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; to (CONT'D) Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube. Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading? Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect. Finally, someone who speaks English. It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. Shall we play, doctor? If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.  Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony. Nothing? You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? Funny things are. You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut. You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables. He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it? That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now. I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files. Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. (holds out a bag of blueberries) Blueberry? An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible. Following is not really my style. (a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use? That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice. What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. (CONT'D) It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does. Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us. You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege. Because I learned how. Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.  You just might. Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you. And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed. I'm sorry, Nick. Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of What were you lying? Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down. (puts his arm around Steve) Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam? (comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. I think I would just cut the wire. (that did it) A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle! Got it. Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer. I can get there faster. You gonna stop me? I'm not afraid to hit an old man. Yep! Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE. (V.O.) I'm on it! Find engine three. I'll meet you there. Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory. Good. See what we got. Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged engine. I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris. Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push. Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag... See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it. Cap, I need the lever! Lever. Now! Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the rotors, getting chewed up. No. There was a uh...cellist, I think. He was an idiot. For taking on Loki alone. He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...  (turns around sharply) WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife! (looking at the blood stained That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why? He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered... Shut it down, Dr. Selvig. Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock. TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into the penthouse. Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you. Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.   (CONT'D) But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them. Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE BRACELETS, a honing device. We have a HULK. You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it. Well, performance issues. You know? In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room. Jarvis. Anytime now. Loki grabs Tony by the throat again. Right. Army. IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN flies towards the city. Fine. Let's keep them occupied. IRON MAN heads back to the portal. I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet? Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot. IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you. IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently. Nice call. What else you got? And he didn't invite me? I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just where to put it.  What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me? Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it. And then shawarma after.\",\n",

TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of gadgets. Levels are holding steady... I think. Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I? No. All this came from that. Points to the energy in his chest plate. Twelve percent? Twelve percent? For my baby? Oooooh. You mean OUR elevator?
