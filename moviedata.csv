0,avengers,TONY,"You're good on this end. The rest is up to you. Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy. I assume. Light her up. As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP. Like Christmas, but with more... me. Pepper, you're killing me. Remember? Enjoy the moment. I'm not in. I'm actually out. Close the line Jarvis. I got a date. Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius? What do you mean? All this came from you. Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit. An argument can be made for fifteen. Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you. My private elevator... ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I? Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne. I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower. ...Call your mom, can you bunk over? You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message. Then leave it urgently. At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears. Security breach. Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent. Which is why he can't stay. I don't like being handed things. Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday. The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify. Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others. Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases. You know, I thought we were having a moment. How did you notice? Why is he Phil? This is, uh... Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and Pepper. This. Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS Tomorrow. Well, what if I didn't? Yeah. Square deal. It's the last date. Pepper kisses him. What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily? Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates? It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle. Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match. Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you. THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake violently. Then don't take my stuff. Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes? He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist. The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mj�lnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree. Okay. From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mj�lnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch! Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mj�lnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back. How about that? IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up. It's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; to (CONT'D) Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube. Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading? Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect. Finally, someone who speaks English. It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. Shall we play, doctor? If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.  Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony. Nothing? You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? Funny things are. You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut. You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables. He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it? That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now. I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files. Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. (holds out a bag of blueberries) Blueberry? An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible. Following is not really my style. (a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use? That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice. What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. (CONT'D) It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does. Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us. You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege. Because I learned how. Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.  You just might. Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you. And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed. I'm sorry, Nick. Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of What were you lying? Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down. (puts his arm around Steve) Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam? (comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. I think I would just cut the wire. (that did it) A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle! Got it. Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer. I can get there faster. You gonna stop me? I'm not afraid to hit an old man. Yep! Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE. (V.O.) I'm on it! Find engine three. I'll meet you there. Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory. Good. See what we got. Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged engine. I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris. Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push. Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag... See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it. Cap, I need the lever! Lever. Now! Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the rotors, getting chewed up. No. There was a uh...cellist, I think. He was an idiot. For taking on Loki alone. He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...  (turns around sharply) WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife! (looking at the blood stained That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why? He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered... Shut it down, Dr. Selvig. Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock. TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into the penthouse. Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you. Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.   (CONT'D) But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them. Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE BRACELETS, a honing device. We have a HULK. You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it. Well, performance issues. You know? In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room. Jarvis. Anytime now. Loki grabs Tony by the throat again. Right. Army. IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN flies towards the city. Fine. Let's keep them occupied. IRON MAN heads back to the portal. I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet? Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot. IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you. IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently. Nice call. What else you got? And he didn't invite me? I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just where to put it.  What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me? Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it. And then shawarma after."
1,avengers,NICK FURY,"How bad is it? NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase. What are the energy levels now? How long to get everyone out? Do better. We should tell them to go back to sleep? I need you to make sure that PHASE 2 prototypes are shipped out. Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone. Talk to me, doctor. DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned. The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings shoot out at random. Is there anything we know for certain? Is that supposed to be funny? How soon until you pull the plug? We've prepared for this, doctor. Harnessing energy from space. That can be harmful. Where's Barton? Agent Barton, report. BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They both walk around the facility in a discreet manner. I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things. Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off? At this end? Sir, please put down the spear! Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss Loki's fired shot. ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him. In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost gone to shit. Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.  We have no quarrel with your people. You planning to step on us? Free from what? Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing. From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion. Like The Pharaohs of Odin. (through the walkie talkie) Hill, do you copy?! Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill. Barton is... He's got the Tesseract! Track it down! The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling. The Tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill? Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case. Coulson, get back to base. This is a LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at war. A beat. You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control? Not Asgard. Loki. Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us. PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team. This isn't about The Avengers. I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need. No, it's won by soldiers. Trouble sleeping? Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down. We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently. I am. Trying to save it. Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on HYDRA'S projects. Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs. He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know. Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment. Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of the gym. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now? Good. Let's vanish. Gentlemen. Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it. Doctor, thank you for coming. Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear. How many are there? Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please. Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall. Captain, you're up. Steve nods. Leaves. (V.O.) Said anything? (V.O.) Just get him here. We're low on time. With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering. In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass. Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though. Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?! Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki. Ant. Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap. Boot. Built for something a lot stronger than you. How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control. (CONT'D) You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.   I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. (O.S.) War hasn't started yet. A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops. I'm asking. What are you prepared to do? Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? Thor doesn't answer.  You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract. (trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're... Because of him. (pointing at Thor) Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned. But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled. You forced our hand. We had to come up with something. Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark? Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up? You need to step away. Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr.Banner back to his... The cell was just in case... Hill?! Stark! You copy that?! Coulson! Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! Move out! Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water. Is the sun coming up?! Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop. We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE appears. Get his attention. They are not getting through here, so what the hell... Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB It's Barton. He took out our systems. He's headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy? (V.O.) Stark, we're losing altitude. Just stay awake. EYES ON ME! Not an option. (V.O.) Agent Coulson is down. Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up. (V.O.) They're here. (V.O.) They called it. These were in Phil Coulson's jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD. We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming. Well, it's an old fashioned notion. Agent Hill? They needed the push. (holding Coulson's cards) A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying off as well as the QUINJET. They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything. I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision, I've elected to ignore it. That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. Until I'm certain my team can't hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population. I send that bird out, we already have. Fury shuts off his viewscreen. RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG- 7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED. Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there, knowing he can't do anything about it. Stark, you hearing me? We have a missile headed straight for the city. Three minutes, at best. Stay low and wipe out the missile. I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a leave of absence. The Tesseract is where it belongs: out of our reach. I didn't make it. I just didn't argue with the god that did. Oh, I think he will be. They surely are. And the whole world knows it. Every world knows it. A promise. They'll come back. I am. Because we'll need them to."
2,avengers,LOKI,"You have heart. Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands straight. As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract, placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then... Please don't. I still need that. Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose. An ant has no quarrel with a boot. I come with glad tidings, of a world made free. Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart... Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart. Selvig's eyes glow BLACK. You will know peace. Well, then... Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling. Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle. Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim. I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed! You don't have the Tesseract yet. THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter. I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton? Tell me what you need. Kneel before me. The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd. Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their spears, encircling the crowd. I said. KNEEL!!! Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing his arms out, smiling. Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel. As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN refuses to kneel and stands, heroic. There are no men like me. Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.  Kneel. I'm not overly fond of what follows. What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet. Not a light. A King. THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony puts the IRON MAN helmet on.  Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth. Thor drops MJ�LNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up Loki. His brother. Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god. Did you mourn? Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them.   Well, yes. I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it... I am a king! I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where. Mj�lnir flies back to his grasp. I'm listening.  Oh, I've heard. Loki looks into the camera. The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you? Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is. There's not many people that can sneak up on me. (turns to see NATASHA After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate. I'd say I've expanded his mind. Is this love, Agent Romanoff?  And what will you do if I vow to spare him?  What is it you want? Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? DRAKOV'S daughter? S�O PAULO? THE HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? (V.O.) You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury oversees. (V.O.) You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away! - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF I won't touch Barton. Not until I make him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In every way he knows you fear! And when he'll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams, I'll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.   Are you ever not going to fall for that? (smiles; walks over to the  Your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky...where is my disadvantage? I don't think I... Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity. You should have left your armor on for that. Stalling me won't change anything. The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear? Yes, I've met them. That was the plan. I have an army. I thought the beast had wandered off. (slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you? Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing. Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING. It should work. You will all fall before me. LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower. From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out. The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit. It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry. You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only the war! (tries to look away) It's too late. It's too late to stopit. Sentiment. Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of CHITAURI follow his lead. Send the rest.  If it's all the same to you. I'll have that drink."
3,avengers,T,"his doesn't have to get any messier. he Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF WHITE LIGHT. Then... he BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it. Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket of rock. On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck. Loki looks up. From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there, holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of he RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT. hat's on you. he QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel. Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with Natasha. hey need you on the bridge. Face time. he doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP � a flurry of activity � dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS. Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY, who is at the command chair. he HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then camouflages in the sky. he soldier. A man out of time. he two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING him into the side of a mountain. THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him. he others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated. Banner looks at the monitor, intently. hanks. ell me. his is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer... PATHETIC! hank you for your cooperation. Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen. ony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall. hor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand out. The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs right at him. At the last second, MJ�LNIR flies into his hand and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET. HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS he gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming. hor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki, escaping. hor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJ�LNIR onto the glass cell. To his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING hor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass, but misses. Land draws closer. In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out into the meadow. hor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJ�LNIR. ony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a word. Steve walks in. he CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame. he QUINJET BOOMS into the city. hor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor. he TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly, the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT. With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them. hey look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people. hor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch the city falling to ash. he TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A he COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT. he rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing still. hor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJ�LNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on he CHITAURI LEVIATHAN CRASHES into a history museum. DEAD. THOR and HULK stand on the BACK of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN after bringing it down. They stand still, admiring. HULK PUNCHES THOR he HULK holds CHITAURI SOLDIERS by the face and SLAMS them down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES hor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to Cap. he Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled, to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case. Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it. The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE. Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now."
4,avengers,BANNER,"Calm down. What's wrong? Is he like them? The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world. Should have got paid up front, Banner. Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns around, quietly. Avoiding stress isn't the secret. You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded? And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young? Who are you? Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone. SHIELD. How did they find me? Why? What if I said no? And what if the... other guy says no? I don't always get what I want. Well, those I actively try to avoid. What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it? So Fury isn't after the monster? And he tells you everything? He needs me in a cage?  I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha... Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece. Just you and me? Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down. Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming. Is that the only word on me? (takes in the sentiment) Must be strange for you, all of this. Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container? They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE  Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying? Where are you with that? Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen. You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to? Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? He really grows on you, doesn't he? So he's building another portal. That's what he needs Erik Selvig for. He's an astrophysicist. I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him. Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for? He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.  Let's play some. As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing. The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process. All I packed was a tooth brush. Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.  No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things. (bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and... 'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube. (pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news. It's powered by Stark Reactors, self- sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year? (referring to Tony) So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place? Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off. The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us. And I'll read all about it. Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare. But you can control it. It's different. Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face. So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life? (CONT'D) That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what? You might not like that. We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile. Did you know about this? I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed. And you've been doing what exactly? Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction. It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're... we're a time-bomb. Yeah, this is a tee... Where? You rented my room. In case you needed to kill me, but you can't! I know! I tried! You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm? BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns. Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all. Oh, my God! Your life? His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the lights go out.  Lucky. You saw? Thank you. A beat. What? No. So, this all seems horrible. Sorry. That's my secret, Captain. I'm always angry. Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN"
5,avengers,THOR,"Where is the Tesseract? Do I look to be in a gaming mood?! I thought you dead. We all did. Our father... We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that? So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki. You think yourself above them. Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up to the ledge. Turns around. Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king? Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home. You listen well, brother. I... and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up. IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet opens up. Do not touch me again! You have no idea what you're dealing with. This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice! and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face. Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor, with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest. IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up, ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift him and SMASH him down hard. Thor summons back Mj�lnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him, but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce... CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN, stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand. I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!  , CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.  Selvig? He's a friend. Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother. He's adopted. Monkeys? I do not understand. Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man. They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we...we come here battling like BILCHSTEIM. BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those? They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come. When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him. What are you asking me to do? Loki is a prisoner.  My people want nothing but peace with your planet. You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war. Did you always give your champions such mistrust? You speak of control, yet you court chaos. You people are so petty... and tiny. Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap. Located the Tesseract? The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it. Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him. We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to think! HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM  Nooo! Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch. He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful. Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it! So be it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself. Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule? No. We can. Together. Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over. The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable. I have unfinished business with Loki. rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting off SOLDIERS. IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing. You ready for another bout? He's not slowing down. Thor swings Mj�lnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK (looking up at Stark Tower) We're not finished yet. A beat."
6,avengers,NATASHA,"I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better. I thought General Soholob was in charge of the export business. You really think I'm pretty? LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open. Are you kidding? I'm working! I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything. Look, you can't pull me out of this right now. Let me put you on hold. She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her, Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider, she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by KICKBOXING him in the face. Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him. She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then Where's Barton now? But he's alive. Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me. Bozhe moi. You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. Then, what is it? Yoga? Just you and me. I did. Natasha Romanoff. No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD. We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent. Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in. I'll persuade you. You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak. Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe. This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet. She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner takes a closer look. Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be. Not that he's told me. Talk to Fury, he needs you on this. No one's gonna put you in a... Stand down. We're good here. Hi. There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? They're vintage, he's very proud. Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in hisway. Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath. Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly ""sail."" That's still not gonna find them in time. You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. Loki, drop the weapon and stand down. Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT. Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's tip on his helmet. The guy's all over the place. Suddenly, AC/DC's ""Shoot to Thrill"" overdrives the QUINJET'S speakers. Not a word. Where's this coming from? Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently. Another Asgardian? I'd sit this one out, Cap. These guys come from legends, they're basically gods. Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours. He killed eighty people in two days. But you figured I'd come. I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton. And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain. What happens to his mind? Love is for children. I owe him a debt. (she pulls up a chair as Not let you out. Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian... or was. It's really not that complicated. I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.  (turns back around; poised) So, Banner... that's your play.  You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor? Loki's manipulating you. You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you. (CONT'D) (quietly, to herself) I'm okay. We're okay, right? Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We're gonna be okay. Listen to me. Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there. We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on my life I will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never...  This is Agent Romanoff. I copy. Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton. Clint, you're gonna be alright. We don't have that long, it's gonna take time. You know that I do. Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head. Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for. Yeah. I don't suppose you know where? We gotta stop him. I don't know. Whoever's left. Now you sound like you. Natasha sits next to her partner and friend. He didn't, I just... I've been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I'd like to wipe it out. Go where?"
0,dumb_and_dumber,LLOYD,"Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? I'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost. I couldn't help noticing the accent. You from Jersey? Austria? You're kidding. (mock-Australian accent) Well, g'day, mate. What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie. (CONT'D) (to self) Guess I won't be going Down Under tonight... This is 22. Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my way. Why you going to the airport? Flying somewhere? Well, I saw your luggage, then when I noticed the airline ticket, I put two and two together. (beat) So where you heading? Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear California's beautiful this time of year. Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another glance. (CONT'D) Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas. Uh, this isn't my real job, you know. It's only temporary. Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store. (smiling) I got worms. That's what we're gonna call it: I Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms. A lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. They're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids. Uh... well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate. And if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back. And best of all, worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year industry. I wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what I mean. (CONT'D) What's the matter? Little tense about the flight? It's really nothing to worry about, Mary. Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. You know, like in a head-on crash, or something. Good thinking. There's a lot of bad rivers out there. Keep it. It was my pleasure. (CONT'D) Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and pass out. You'll be there before you know it. (to car's driver) Drive around me, you pinhead! Damn! I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. Of course not. (beat) I quit. I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire me. Winners control their own destiny, Har. Big deal. That car's an old bomb anyway. That's forty-two in dog years. It's a love memento. The most beautiful woman alive. Her name was Mary. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved. She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life. End of story. DO you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else's private property? (beat) It's locked. (CONT'D) (WHISPERING to Harry) Friend or foe? Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little swindlers gave me Peanut Butter Praline. (cringing) That's a hostile pattern. I say we bail and get down to unemployment. Blew it? For your information, we only missed three days in two months. Give me what's left of our dough. I'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities. (CONT'D) What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night Train? Excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar? Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar? My wallet's locked in this machine. It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma Walton. She got my wallet, too. (CONT'D) Come on, man, cheer up. We've been own before. I'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere. HARRY It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet Petey he's... he's dead. Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What happened? His head fell off? (hopeful) I don't suppose he had a warranty...? That's it! I've had it with this ump! We don't have food, we don't have jobs, our pets' heads are falling off, we're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old No I won't calm down. (CONT'D) What the hell are we doing here anyway, Harry? We've got to get out of this town. HARRY Yeah, and go where? I'll tell you where: someplace warm, a place where the beer flows like wine, where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. (dramatic PAUSE) I'm talking about Aspen. That's right, Aspen. Let me ask you something: do you want to end up like Petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment, face- down on a Dear Abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? Or do you want to enjoy your life? (beat) Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's eath be in vain. Don't you see what he was saying? Spread your wings, man. he was saying? Spread your wings, man. Fly. That's bullshit. I'll drive. (beat) And what's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline? HARRY (torn) I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep saving money for the worm store. I'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors. You know what I'm sick and tired of, Harry? I'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. I'm sick and tired of being a nobody. (MORE) (CONT'D) (beat) But most of all, I'm sick and tired of having nobody. On the other hand, maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court. With all those lawsuits against us, I'm sure we'll win at least one. It could be a boost to our egos. & HARRY ""We've got to get out of this place, If it's the last thing we ever do, We've got to get out of this place, Girl, there's a better life, for me and you..."" Well, we're finally doing it. Do you realize that in all the years we've known each other, this is the first time we've done this together. Taken a trip. (CONT'D) Why'd you do that? Take your seatbelt off. Well what about the people who live around here? What if we got into an accident with one of them? Bought 'em when we filled up. This didn't come out of our travel fund. I was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left. You know, so we could live in style. I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C. That's right. Just some odds and ends. Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Well who else was I gonna sell it to? Put your mind at ease, friend. I took care of it. According to this map, about an inch and a half. And I believe I'm right, Harry. How much you wanna bet? What do you mean you don't bet? Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal that I can get you gambling before the day's out. I'll give you three-to-one odds. That's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose. Okay, five-to-one I can get you gambling before the day's out. Make it ten-to-one. Harry sticks out his hand. (to Waitress) (CONT'D) What's the soup du jour? Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.  Uh-oh... You spilled the salt. That's bad luck. We're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder. Because that's good luck. Or was it the left shoulder? Well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals... (brightening) Wait a second. I think I just had an idea. Follow me... (CONT'D) Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier. What I'm trying to say is, my friend and I would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the hatchet. Whatever you want, sir. I'll have the waitress send them over. Oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road. Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check. They said just add this to their tab. Well, if that guy at the table over there is Sea Bass... (to Cashier) By the way, how far is it to Rhode Island from here? I just wish we could've seen Sea Bass's face when he got the bill. Don't worry. That fish-head is probably half-way to Providence by now. Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a whiz. But I gotta go. What am I supposed to do? I can't hold it. I'm about to explode. Are you serious? Uh-oh... The bottle's almost full and I'm still going. I can't stop once I already started, you know that. Quick, get me another bottle. (CONT'D) Jesus, be careful! You almost went off the road. Here, hold this. Hey, I haven't gone all day. But, your honor, he's telling the truth. It's not beer. (under breath) YOU WOULD, TOO... 'S FANTASY: (v.o.) (v.o.) Nothing. Nothing at all. (v.o.) Hey, it's the only motel that charges by the hour. We can't afford anything else. Yep, this sure is the life. Cold beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink sheets... You know, there's only one thing that could make this moment any better. If you had a nice set of knockers. Right now I'd settle for one. What happened, Harry? Some little filly break your heart? Felcher? You mean the babe who worked for the tractor company? That's cold, Har. Give you any reason? You're it. You're it. Quitsies. Damn, you're good, Harry. (beat) Hey, didn't I tell you this trip would be a blast? See, I told you these country folks were friendly, Harry. Well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous Aspenese air. The freshest. They say on any day of the week you can smell a moose-fart ten miles away. Then we make a splash on the social scene. (CONT'D) Harry, look the golden arches. Pull over, I'm starving. CUT TO: Look, once we drop the briefcase off to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll plug us right into the party circuit. After that, we do a little of the ski Some bum down at unemployment. What's the matter? Yeah? So? (CONT'D) Hey, wait a second. Hold everything. Aren't you forgetting something? (CONT'D) Back at Mickey D's? A little matter you might've overlooked...? My change. It's a vegetable. And I happen to know it's a vegetable. Fine with me. Okay, Harry, my turn. Let 'er rip. (CONT'D) Hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet, aged to perfection will rip no fart before it's time. (beat) Come on, Marquis of Dingleberry's rules: you got ten seconds. All right. I'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog extra onions, garden salad with blue... Kit-Kat bar. Okay, you go first. No, you go first. Hmmm, not bad... Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you. Perhaps it's about time you brushed No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.' Hand me those peppers the atomic ones. More like re-location. Not really. I was just her limo river. Life is a fragile thing, Har. One minute you're chewing on a burger; the next minute you're dead meat. If you don't count that gurgling sound. (CONT'D) Hey, relax, man, I'm just as responsible as you are we both slipped him the peppers and look at me, I on't feel guilty at all. That's ridiculous. You probably won't live to see forty. Sorry, Har. We're gonna have to hold out. Seems we misjudged our expense allocation. If we pay for a motel we won't have enough for gas. We over-leveraged. The slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe and a chocolate malt. Drive. We've only got ten more hours. We can take turns. Um, yeah could you do it the other way around? Look, Harry, I told you what happened, now drop it. HARRY Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to mention another word about you being in a bathroom stall with a six-foot, five-inch trucker with his pants own. That's a low blow, man. Listen, bud, if you're trying to imply that I'm that thought look, we're almost in Colorado. Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky... (CONT'D) Boy, some guys just weren't cut out for life on the road. Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back. I'd say a good five hours, anyway. Should be. I've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night. Boy, I'll tell you, this is one angerous highway. You wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing I couldn't even recognize. I hit 'em. I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver's some full of shit, huh? (CONT'D) I must say, Des Moines sure is a pretty little town. Last night. We drove through it. (sing-song) Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and shine. (LAUGHS) You were the one who was asleep, In our country it does, yes. I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can make a mistake. (CONT'D) Come on, man, pull yourself together. (rolls his eyes) You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo. (CONT'D) Come on, stop being a baby about this. Okay, so we back-tracked a tad. Well it doesn't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it. If we're gonna get out of this hole, we're gonna have to dig ourselves out. Where you going? You can't be serious. (CALLING OUT) Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you never screwed up. Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his friend. He seems completely rained. Got room for one more, if you still want to go to Aspen. Used car dealer. I   traded the van for it. Plus I got   the guy to throw in fifty bucks for   gas money. (beat) Come on, man, what   do you say? We still partners? Tell me something, Harry. Would you really have kept going home if I hadn't come back to get you? We were never Cub Scouts. Relax, it's empty. Isn't this wonderful? What more could a couple of single guys like us ask for? You're so materialistic. (beat) Why don't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to Mary. Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two? Um... good question. Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I caught that either. (brightening) Come to think of it, there is. It's engraved right into the leather. Samsonite   spelled just like it sounds. A little. Shall we share it? Mmmm mmmm good... Hmmm... looks like an old piece of Beef Jerky. You're pathetic. Get your own. Roll up your window. Then I guess the damn anti-cold system isn't working. You really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter. Right here the A/C button. I put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder. (CONT'D) What are you going out there for? What are you worrying about now? Huh? (CONT'D) Harry, calm down! You're acting like a wild animal! Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine. I'm a Christian Scientist! (CONT'D) What are you doing? Don't do anything foolish, Harry. You're making a big mistake, Harry! I'll never forgive you for this! (CONT'D) Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get better, I promise! In fact, I think No I'm not, man look. (CHOKED VOICE) Harry, look! Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel. And we'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs. That way, whatever we borrow we can pay back. You know, as soon as we get jobs. Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our own chicks. Tell you what you can send up, my friend how about some chow? Don't bother. Just order us one of everything. Oh, sorry. (beat) Make that two of everything. Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in Barnard's top pocket. (CONT'D) And here you go, Barney. You keep us happy, we'll keep you happy. (proudly) Our first IOU. Signed and dated. It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked the big time. What's the big deal? We're gonna pay it all back anyway, right? Surfboards? I thought those were beginner's skis. This suddenly makes sense to Harry. Where'd this come from? What for? Harry, how many women do you know who wear a size XXL? Enter, parlez vous! All out of Boone's Farm, huh? BARNARD You have a rapier wit, sir. I took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute: Dom Perignon. Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh? Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it, Barney, we're all from the     same mold. (winks) We just have a little more     dough than you right now. (dumbstruck) Harry, it's her. Mary with the briefcase. This is her... (CONT'D) Mary Swanson... Thanks for the lift, Barney. This should cover a couple plates. I'm getting nervous, Harry. What are you talking about? They're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated. Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't like me? (to BARTENDER) Two martinis, straight up. As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away. (CONT'D) Shut up, Harry. Yeah, well I know what you were gonna say and I'm telling you to shut up in advance. I read you like a book. You were gonna say: (in Harry's looped VOICE) 'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in.' (CONT'D) And I would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like Ron Jeremy on Spanish Fly. Two more, please. I can't help it. This is a very important night for me. (MORE) (CONT'D) (beat) Harry, have you ever wondered why you and I never have long-term girlfriends? That was a fluke. (beat) The reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing: We're afraid of the C word. I'm talking bout commitment. Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry. The first time I laid eyes on Mary Swanson, I knew she was the one. (beat) Some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. This girl makes me feel it all in the heart. (CONT'D) Oh shit, there she is. She's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far I came just to see her. And then what? She'll take it back and that'll be it. I'm a nobody. (brightening) Wait a second, I have an idea. You go over and introduce yourself. That way you can build me up so when I come along I won't have to brag about myself. Tell her I'm good-looking and I'm rich and I have a rapist's wit. Please Harry, I'm appealing to you as one loser to another. Just build me up and then give me a signal to come over. Please. How come you didn't call me over? Wha... you... I... it's... (smiles) I love you, man. I love you! This calls for a toast! (CONT'D) You're gonna be my best man, Har, I mean it. It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal. Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs. Mary Christmas. You Impossible. I know my type    when I see it. Now let me get this    straight, she wants me to meet her at    the Avalanche Bar and Grill on    Main Street? Time out. Where are going ressed like that. You mean you're gonna go out in public dressed in tights? But you can see the outline of your who-who. Turn sideways. (CONT'D) Actually, it's just a tiny little lump. No one will ever notice. I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait at the bar? Maybe some other time. (CONT'D) Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to know a Mary Swanson, would you? Do you know where she lives? Some best man. Believe me, it was the right place. (SIGHS) I don't know, Har, maybe she just had second thoughts. What? (brightening) Do ya think...? (shrugging) I just figured she was a raging alcoholic. I knew there was an explanation. And here I thought she was standing me up. Will you join me in a good luck toast before you head out? Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't you? I see. (CONT'D) To my friend Harry the matchmaker. Hi. (beat) Don't you remember me? South Bend. I drove you to the airport last week. You remembered. I brought you your briefcase You left it at the airport so I picked it up for you. Yeah, it's back at my hotel room. Come on, let's take a ride. I'll give it to you. ..So anyway, as soon as I got to town I tried to look you up but I idn't know your last name. 'Course I have it. When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman to the airport, he makes sure she gets all her luggage, no matter what he has to Well... no... I mean, you know, there were other reasons... (beat) Actually, yeah, I guess I did. Look, Mary, I know this may seem a little sudden but I've given it a lot of thought: You're the woman I've been waiting for my whole life, and I'm not ashamed to admit it -- (holds up his hand) --Please, let me finish. (DEEP BREATH) I'm crazy about you. I've never felt this way about anyone. You make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires. (NERVOUS LAUGH) Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy again. (beat) A schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet, sweet love to you. Mary... (BLURTING OUT) I desperately want to make love to a schoolboy. No, that's not what Imeant. I meant... I really like you, Mary. I like you a lot. (CONT'D) I'm gonna ask you something flat out and I want you to answer me honestly: What do you think the chances are of a girl like you and a guy like me ending up together? --I asked you to be honest, Mary. MARY But Lloyd, I really can't -- --Come    on, give it to me straight. I rove a    long way to see you, the least you can    do is level with me. What are my    chances? You mean not good, like one out of a hundred? (Duh) So you're telling me there's a chance? Husband? Who are you? Uh-oh. Uh, sir, about the briefcase, I want you to know, my friend Harry and I have every intention of reimbursing you. That's as good as money, sir. Those are our IOUs. You can add them up yourself. Every penny's accounted for. Now don't do anything hasty, man. (cutting) Yeah, we used to be best friends. Me a backstabber? You got a lot of nerve. I saw her first. But you knew how crazy I was about her. (waning righteousness) What are you talking about? You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were. I mean, if one beautiful girl   could rip us apart like this, then   it seems our friendship isn't worth a   damn. (beat) Maybe we should call it quits   right here. Mary's married, Harry. No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the one who got you into this mess. Jesus Christ! You killed my best friend, you bastard! Harry! You're alive! (dumbstruck) You gotta be kidding. (to Athletic Beauty) But how did you...? She's something, ain't she, Har? HARRY You were right, Lloyd. She was efinitely worth the trip. Guess we have to admit it, she was too good for us. Look, we just wanted to say that we appreciate all you did for us during our stay. Well, anyway, thanks again for everything. This joint is a little out of our budget, Barney. You know what, Barney, I think we'll take out chances down the road. (v.o.) I say we head due south and try a little nose-rubbing with some of them slinky eskimo babes."
1,dumb_and_dumber,HARRY,"Okay, gang, single file. You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies... The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell. You kids stay right here... (CONT'D) (at truck) Hey, wait a minute! I got fired again. None taken. Were you shitcanned, too? Why'd you quit? Why didn't you wait and see if your suspicions were well-founded? You know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that I just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle. (beat) The alarm alone cost me two hundred. What are you talking about? It's only six years old. What's with the briefcase? Huh? What's in it? Why not? 'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental are standing at the door. (WHISPERING) We don't have any friends. (CONT'D) Can't recognize them. Could be student loan thugs again, or the IRS, or maybe somebody pissed off about that case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced a check on. Well, whoever they are, they look serious. One of them's even wearing plaid. Yeah, and that was because of a blizzard Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find something else for us. How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline? Get Robitussin it's a better buzz. Where's the booze? His head fell off. Yeah, he was pretty old. Nah, I bought him used. Okay, calm down. Aspen? I don't know, Lloyd, the French are assholes. (confused) What are you talking about, Lloyd? His head fell off. (dawning realization) Wait a second, I know what you're up to. You just wanna go to Aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there. Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss. (emotional) Petey, I made a promise to you once, man... (thinking hard) ...and I'll be damned if I can remember what it was. Been run out of town? What? Because we just cleared the danger zone. LLOYD Huh? Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. We've already traveled 6.3 miles. Where'd you get those? Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures. We're on a tight budget, remember? Where'd you get twenty-five extra bucks? You mean the blind kid? What did you sell him, Lloyd? Specifically? But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a head. How far have we gone? Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there. We don't have enough gas money. LLOYD Relax. We have more than enough. I believe you're wrong, Lloyd. I still say wrong, Lloyd. I don't bet. I mean I don't gamble, you know that. Never have and never will. There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do it. You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I already told you, I don't gamble. Sorry, pal, no way. You got yourself a bet, sucker! Actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well. Could you please bring me a spoon? What's the matter? What for? It was a terrible accident, Sir. Believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size. Please accept my most sincere apology. Um... the thought had crossed my mind. Nah, you go ahead. Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I still haven't eaten. Lloyd, what are you doing? You know we can't afford to buy them drinks. Oh, and put these on there, too. I hope we never have to. I hope so. Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now. What if they figure out we went the other way. They'll be on us in no time. Hold it. Well... just take a whiz in an empty beer bottle. There's a couple on the floor in the back seat. Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping now. We could get killed. Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND. Then: What's the matter? Well stop going. I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best I can. What are you, a goddamn camel? Huh? (calling out) No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for noticing! (CONT'D) Jesus, what is this, the fashion police? Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty in the car. No, sir. Oh, that's nothing, sir. Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you. (v.o.) I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little sleazy staying here when we're not even engaged. What's that? That's two things, Lloyd. I don't know, Lloyd, these places just don't do it for me. Brings back too many memories. Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher. We stayed at a place like this once No-Tell Motel out on Route 31. The same. We had this incredibly romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd be together forever. (SIGHS) Then about a week later, right out of the blue, she sends me a John Deere letter. I called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that. I wasn't really paying attention. (CONT'D) Thing that really hurts is I think she was seeing another guy. Never id find out who. You're it. (tapping him back) Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies. No anti-quitsies. No startsies. Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd: what exactly do we do when we get to Aspen? Fresh, huh? (sincere) Wow... talk about paradise. (beat) And after we're finished breathing, what next, Lloyd? Thanks. About this social scene how do you expect a couple mutts like us to make a splash in the land of pedigrees when we don't even have any money? I don't know, Lloyd. Money does terrible things to people. I mean, we could lose our friendship. What? What? I think this guy's in trouble. Why on't you pull over. It's a fruit. I'm telling you, it's a fruit. Tell you what, why don't we leet an impartial judge decide. Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet: Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables? And...? You're the best, man. (beat) Okay, my turn. LLOYD Where are your manners, Harry? We have a guest. Come on, Mr. Mentalino. Let one fly. It's only a buck. I'll do one if you will. No, you go first. Yeah, more tingly than hot. That really wasn't very polite of him, was it? Maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair. (humbled) You mean like 'turn the other cheek?' (whispering) Here he comes. The briefcase isn't even ours. Some lady just left it at the airport. We're bringing it back to her. Hey, you okay, man? It was just a goof. I can't believe it... But he blamed me. You heard him. Those were his last words. Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids. (SIGHS) Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a ead guy pissed at me. His restless spirit will probably haunt me for the next seventy-five years. Let's get off and crash at a motel before I crash into one. (yawning) I need a crib fast. What happened to the dough? On what? LLOYD I sprung for Mr. Chili Pepper's last meal. Felt it was the least we could o after we deep-sixed him. Wait a second one burger put us over budget? Oh. (beat) So what are we gonna do? Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump. Skis, huh? Great. (CONT'D) They yours? Both of 'em? (impressed) Cool. (re: suitcases in back seat) That's a lot of luggage for a little vacation. (holding out mirror) Here, this is a little loose. (CONT'D) Allow me... (CONT'D) Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen we can meet up... you know, for hot chocolate or something. (urgently) Look, why don't you just tell it to me, I've got a good memory. (desperate) Positive please hurry. You've got some serious explaining to o, young man. Not at that height it's not. I think it's about   time we pull over and change seats.   I've been driving for nine straight   hours I  don't have the energy to   start a new state. (groggy) How long have I been out? Great. We must be getting real close, huh? Good man. That's awful. Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there? Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this. Yeah, it really is. (beat) Wait a minute when did you visit Des Moines? What are you talking about? You were snoring like a baby when we went through Des Moines. Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't the sun rise in the east and set in the west? Then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at 7:30 in the morning when we're heading west. You know, I got half a mind to just jump on the bus to Europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever. Oh yeah? Why not? LLOYD You don't have a passport. A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction. Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen, we on't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough to eat, we don't have enough to sleep! You know, you're absolutely right, Lloyd. Home. I'm walking home. (sarcastic) Why not? We're probably only five miles away. Look, man... I'm sorry. (beat) I never should have let you talk me into this in the first place. You've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl's waiting for you. But let's face it, Lloyd, there's nothing waiting for me in Aspen. (beat) There's nothing waiting for me anywhere. Where'd you find this baby? Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember that? Exactly. (CONT'D) What the hell is this? There's a coffin in the back! I don't give a shit. I'm not driving anywhere with a casket. You know I'm superstitious calm down. We'll dump it off first chance we get. How about food and shelter? Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes the lovely young lady reside? Well what's her last name? We'll look it up in the phone book. What is it? Any soup left? Please. Hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth. Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it. Wanna split it? I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd. It is rolled up. What anti-cold system? To warm up. I'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling I'm about to give you. Get over here and take your medicine, Lloyd! Something I should've done a long time ago. This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along. Foolish? This is the most sensible thing I've done in years. I'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river. Lloyd starts to follow after Harry. You're bluffing. That's a filling, you liar! (CONT'D) I used to have a life! A miserable one, but a life, nonetheless! Sounds good. We'll be meticulous    right down to the last penny. Absolutely. We're good for it. It'll come right out of our first paycheck. Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up. What are their names? One of everything? Lloyd... Oh god, it's really true. Last night I thought I might've been dreaming. And it was so simple. All it took was somebody else's money. (CONT'D) You know, Lloyd, I think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today. Sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards? Ahhh. I was wondering why you had those bindings put on them. (sheepishly) I bought it. I like the feel of it against my skin... (defensive) ...I mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it. Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now. I'm supposed to have a few eccentricities. Cocktail hour has commenced! (CONT'D) Hey, later on what do you say we...? (CONT'D) Lloyd... you okay? Who? Come on, Cinderella, it's time to get you ready for the ball... I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if we want seconds? relax, Lloyd. These people are just like you and me. So what? We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound. Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. A little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence. I didn't say anything. How do you know what I was gonna say? Okay, if you read me like a book then what was I gonna say? Lloyd, I've never seen you this uptight. You've gotta chill out. What are you talking about? I went out with Fraida Felcher for two and a half weeks. That's crazy. We live for the C word. (beat) Oh. (checking her out) Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd. She's an angel. (beat) Well, what are you waiting for? Get over there and talk to her. You have her briefcase she's gonna be thrilled to see you. Look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl. Don't quit on the last fifty feet. I can't tell her you're good looking, Lloyd she's got eyes. All right. But you're gonna owe me a big one for this. (CONT'D) Nice set of hooters you got there. The owls. They're beautiful. Well, I used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines that's dogs to the layperson. Oh, I've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; I've even bred them. Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But one time we successfully mated a Bulldog and a Shitzu. Yeah. We called it a Bullshit. (breaks out LAUGHING) Just a little breeder joke. (CONT'D) Anyway, the real reason I came over is because I want to introduce you to a friend of mine. Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you both. (taken aback) You were? Really? (CONT'D) Anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because I believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. Whuh? Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball. (CONT'D) Um... well... I don't know. You see, the thing is... sure. Relax, you're golden. I got you a ate with her tomorrow. Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene. (under breath) I think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd. Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you think you may be jumping the gun a little? I mean, who knows, when you get to know her, you may find out she's not your type. That's what she said. Ten o'clock sharp. I, uh, thought while you were making your love connection I'd try my luck on the slopes. These aren't tights. They're fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers. Really? You're right. I can't go out dressed like this. Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving a clutch with these things. (CALLING OUT) You take the first run alone. I'm gonna loosen up down here. Glorious. Why not? Thanks. (CONT'D) Oh, look... frost. (lisping) Sure. I do this all the time... CUT TO: (lisping) See ya at the bottom... (lisping) Hi. (off their looks) Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to have a cup of warm water, would you? (lisping) I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off. My pleasure, Mary. Better make it quarter to eight. I've got a few things to take care of first. (CONT'D) (to himself) Mary Dunne... Mrs. Mary Dunne... Got a nice ring to it. I have a hard time believing that, Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't wait to see you again. (CONT'D) Wait a minute... It just occurred to me. She must've meant ten o'clock at night. Of course! Why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the morning? Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties? That'll teach you to jump to conclusions. (beat) Anyway, since you have your night all (o.s.) Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think will help your chances. Uh... it's for mature audiences. I on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door. Huh? Um, no, I was just... shaving. (o.s.) Yeah! I was running a little late. Thought this would save time. (under breath) Come on, flush, you bastard... Uh... just cleaning my teeth. Give me a minute, Mary, I'll be right with you. But Mary -- (MUMBLING to himself) It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw your best friend over and it's gonna come back to haunt you, plain and simple... You...? What are you doing here? Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta talk, man. I have a serious confession to make. (CONT'D) Oh good, you found her. I'll just leave you two kids alone. Until he turned into a backstabber. Hey, I couldn't help it if she found me irresistable. Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't stop you, did it? Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me the whole sordid story. Well I guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we? Guess not. Just tell me where to sign, bud. I wouldn't pull that trigger if I were you. (smug) Except you're forgetting one minor etail. If you kill us, you'd be killing yourself. You see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. In other words, I am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened Husband? What husband? Kill her. The bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. It would've saved us a lot of trouble. No, wait, do me first. I'm the one who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve it. She grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up. They slapped this on me and gave me a gun. Yeah, about that dough... Hey, Barney... And we're, um, sorry about the money we gave you turning out to be phony. BELL CAPTAIN Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The Swanson family has promised to reimburse everyone. I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer camp somewhere to call home. Are you on the level? (v.o.) Since we're finished elbow-rubbing, what next, lloyd? (v.o.) Now you're talking my language. You know I got a weakness for blondes."
2,dumb_and_dumber,H,"e SIGHS and zips the window back up. arry chases after the vehicle. e pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim. e takes off after it, but to no avail. LLOYD You can't do this! I'll lose my job! arry is still squinting out the peephole. arry hands his friend some crumpled bills. e drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper. He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper, and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET STILL INSIDE. arry drops his head and lets out a MOAN. arry sees that Lloyd has a point. He stands and approaches Petey's cage. His eyes fill with tears. arry's behind the wheel and Lloyd's in the passenger seat. The Animal's ""We've Got to Get Out of This Place"" is BLASTING on the radio and the guys are SINGING ALONG: arry reaches over and UNDOES HIS SEATBELT. Lloyd watches, curious. arry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back on. Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio. arry is still driving while Lloyd studies a map spread out before him. arry wipes off his straw with a napkin. As he moves to put it in the ashtray, he accidentally arry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it over his shoulder. Suddenly they hear a arry stares at the burger non-commitally. arry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the Truckers seem to like the idea. e points across the room to Sea Bass and company. Sea Bass NODS TO THE CASHIER AND GESTURES TO HIS TABLE, NOT WANTING TO MISS OUT ON HIS FREE DRINK. The Cashier is convinced. arry smiles at this. He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter. arry checks his rear-view mirror nervously. arry can BARELY HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL as he reaches way in the back seat for an empty. e hands Lloyd another empty and Lloyd quickly makes the switch. arry is doing his best to steer while now holding FIVE FULL BOTTLES AND Lloyd is still going at it in the passenger seat. arry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at the Trooper. e rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled Lloyd. arry hands him the papers. STATE TROOPER (CONT'D) You know, you fellas were all over the road back there. e points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat between them. arry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down the piss. He pauses uncertainly and a SICK LOOK COMES OVER HIS FACE. He takes a DEEP BREATH. Then: arry nods. arry reaches for a beer and busts it open. He takes a big gulp. arry taps Lloyd back. arry hands a ten-dollar-bill to the Employee, who returns a handful of change. arry thinks about this. arry nods and looks out the window. Suddenly SOMETHING DAWNS ON LLOYD. arry thinks about this. arry wracks his brain, but to no avail. arry turns to Joe Mental. arry lifts a cheer and lets out a LOUD FART. Lloyd SNIFFS a few times, then closes his eyes and WAFTS it up toward his nostrils, as if it was the aroma of a fine wine. arry throws up his arms, defeated. He hands Lloyd a buck. arry punches Mental's shoulder playfully. arry passes the jar and the two of them LOAD JOE MENTAL'S BURGER WITH CHILI arry checks Mental's coat pocket        for his antacid pills but unwittingly brings out the BLACK        OF CYANIDE PILLS. He shakes some pills out and hands them to        Mental, who tosses them in his mouth and starts to MUNCH on        them. arry lets out a GROAN. arry perks up, cheered by this thought. HARRY Oh yeah. (beat) Wow. What a relief. e holds up the container of cyanide pills. Dt. Dale nods and approaches another COP in the b.g. arry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up. arry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs out. This seems to wake Harry up. arry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump as she smiles to herself. e frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch. e's such a klutz. My astrologer told me I should avoid accident-prone guys. e pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish. The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks. Harry tosses the match to the ground, and we hear an O.S. WHOOSH! Wisps of smokes rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING BURNING. (Neither of them notice this.) arry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames. This only helps to fan them. e begins hopping around violently. arry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from screaming. arry breathes a DEEP SIGH of relief. Only then does he notice LLOYD ON HIS KNEES AND arry has to do a DOUBLE-TAKE for this to sink in. Then he lets out an admonishing arry yawns and stretches. arry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing FLATLANDS. arry lets out a defeated SIGH. arry thinks about this. e stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward the highway. arry starts resolutely toward the road while Lloyd watches. arry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out unenthusiastically. A few cars WHIZ by, the cold wind whipping at his clothes. arry looks the hearse over. arry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse. Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is a CADILLAC. arry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back. Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER AND WIPE THEIR HANDS arry throws Lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone booth next to them. arry's concern grows. HARRY What about the briefcase, Lloyd? There must've been a name on it, right? arry starts flipping through the phone book. Then abruptly HE STOPS and puts the book down, a DEFEATED look on his face. arry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted. He opens the car door and starts to climb out. arry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river. arry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose of the briefcase. arry stops in his tracks, intrigued. arry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd as we see THEIR POV - THE BRIEFCASE IS LYING BUSTED OPEN ON THE GROUND, REVEALING STACKS AND arry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching the briefcase. The city is lit up with millions of tiny lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland. arry forces a. embarrassed half-smile. e bows and leaves the room. Then Lloyd cracks open the briefcase and inserts a SMALL PIECE elen Swanson is KNOCKING on her step-daughter's bedroom door. She's holding a tray with a couple of mugs on it. elen grabs the mug from Mary and hands her the other one. elen pulls out a joint and torches it up. She takes a hit. arry LIGHTS A CIGAR WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, takes a hearty puff, and e blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony. e puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads for the door. e starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins thumbing through the newspaper. e notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something he's found in the paper. e shoves the newspaper at Harry. arry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels e points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party. Lloyd rolls his eyes. arry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED. e pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE OWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS. arry stares at Lloyd with concern. arry thinks about this a moment. arry SIGHS. arry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls. arry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a hopeful Lloyd. e grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to open it. arry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar. arry looks down at his crotch. arry turns his profile against the window. arry and Mary are at the front of the lift line. The couple ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into position. Harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair. The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a smooth pick up of Mary, that is. An embarrassed Harry is STILL IN THE CROUCHING POSITION, having missed the ride. Mary looks back at him, confused. Suddenly he pretends to be stretching. arry and Mary are now sitting together on a chair as it rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top. Harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously. e looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar. e licks it and his TONGUE IMMEDIATELY FUSES WITH THE FROZEN METAL. He tugs a few times, but it won't budge. arry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down the hill. arry watches, lovestruck, as Mary gets out of the car and walks toward the house. arry paces back and forth when suddenly SOMETHING OCCURES TO HIM. arry BARKS OUT A LAUGH at their stupidity. arry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway. HARRY Mmmmm... e GULPS DOWN THE DRINK. arry's driving along, WHISTLING happily to himself in anticipation of the night. Suddenly we hear a LOW, INTESTINAL RUMBLE. He reacts and rubs his stomach. arry follows her inside. arry's got his pants back on and is lifting the lid off the toilet tank. He starts tinkering with a few valves. arry's got the eintire toilet completely DISASSEMBLED now. Various pieces of the commode litter the floor, including the big plastic float ball. He's on his knees tinkering with some pipes coming out of the wall. arry hears her FOOTSTEPS echo down the hallway and then the front DOOR CLOSING. Harry slumps against the sink, defeated. HARRY Great... e leads her to the closed BRIEFCASE which is sitting on the bed. e drops his head and Mary leans over and kisses him on the cheek. arry turns to see the Athletic Beauty approaching. arry gets out of the elevator and lets himself into the Presidential Suite. arry ENTERS looking contrite and CALLS OUT: arry comes around the corner and STOPS COLD. arry turns to go, but bumps into the MUZZLE OF ANDRE'S GUN. arry glares at him. arry gestures with his head at Mary. e aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, a SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand. arry and Lloyd EXHALE A SIGH OF RELIEF. arry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out of the car. Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys. arry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond. They look at each other, and we arry and Lloyd look at each other, confused. arry and Lloyd lock eyes. Then:"
3,dumb_and_dumber,T,"he Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away. he dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE: he vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it. he door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR. PALMER, sticks his head out. he double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when he lays eyes on her. o her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's concerned about something. hen she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal, followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her, ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight. he Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at each other, dumbstruck. he place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture with stuffing spilling out of the gashes. hey open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry notices the briefcase. hey take another sip of their beers. Suddenly we hear a LOUD KNOCK at the door. Petey the parakeet starts to SQUAWK. The guys look at each other, ALARMED, then Harry tip-toes to the he poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building and PARKS NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRANT. Lloyd and Harry climb out. Lloyd takes a trash can and places it OVER THE he Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb. A depressed Lloyd and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building entrance. he door opens and Lloyd ENTERS. Harry is sitting on the couch, looking almost comatose. here's a deadly SILENCE as they both think about this. Then Harry tries to lighten the mood. He opens his arms wide. he Mutt Cutts van is going down the highway while Danny Wilson's ""Mary's Prayer"" plays on the soundtrack. The van drives past and we HOLD ON a sign that reads: ""YOU ARE LEAVING he Mutt Cutt van is sandwiched between mountainous tractor- trailer trucks. he Waitress reluctantly returns to the table. he Waitress SIGHS and picks up the milk. Then she BLOWS INTO THE STRAW, MIXING THE DRINK. he guys watch her stomp away. hey turn and see a burly TRUCKER wiping salt out of his eyes. he huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry. He's wearing a FOAM BASEBALL CAP that says: WINE 'EM, DINE 'EM, SIXTY-NINE 'EM. he Trucker GROWLS and approaches the table, egged on by his equally burly FRIENDS. he front door BURSTS OPEN and a red-faced Sea Bass STORMS OUT, followed by his buddies, the Cashier, and the Waitress. he Truckers jump in their rigs and RUMBLE AWAY   in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION our boys are headed. he Mutt Cutts van breezes by. INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON hey turn to see the POLICE MOTORCYCLE cruising right beside then. Harry rolls down his window and CALLS OUT: he Cop turns on his SIREN. he STATE TROOPER is walking up beside the stopped Mutt Cutts van, staring at it with isapproval. he officer smirks. he Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He inspects the beer label, then MOVES he Mutt Cutts van is pulling back onto the highway while the officer remains in the breakdown lane with his hands on his knees. he van is making steady progress through the dark night. he Mutt Cutts van is parked outside this seedy establishment. A neon sign blinks: GROUP he ANXIOUS MAN taps on the phone booth and motions for Mental to hang up. he atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. Karl Swanson holds his hand out to his aughter. he black Cadillac pulls over to the side of the road. Joe Mental gets out of the car and props the hood open. He takes out his gun, SLIDES IN A NEW CLIP, and puts it back in his pocket. hrough the windshield we can see Mental waving. The guys don't slow down, through. The just WAVE BACK as they BLOW RIGHT BY HIM. Harry also toots the horn, which makes the he Mutt Cutt car is at the drive-through window. hen, before he can  give them   the bag of food, the guys absentmindedly DRIVE  OFF. As   they pull out of the parking lot, the McDonald's  Employee   sticks his head out the window and WAVES THE BAG OF  FOOD at   them. he Mutt Cutt van is on the road again, cruising along. hey're back on the highway and Joe Mental is SITTING BETWEEN THEM, looking extremely ANNOYED. The guys are in the middle of an argument. he trio have picked up SIX MIGRANT WORKERS and everyone is crammed into the car including a CRYING BABY who sits on a pissed-off Mental's lap. Someone's playing a FLAMENCO GUITAR and the gang is SINGING a SPANISH SONG. he Migrant Family is gone now. Harry and Lloyd are playing a game while Mental stares straight ahead, furious. His eyes are watering and he looks ill. he boys run to the bar and DUMP PITCHERS OF WATER ON THEIR HEADS, much to the elight of a CHUCKLING Joe Mental. his is news to Mental. he boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help him. he Cop consults his note pad. he Detective looks confused, as we he boys are extremely exhausted as they plow through the black night toward Aspen. he room has a dirt floor. There's a stone WELL in the middle. We hear MUFFLED HUMAN WHIMPERING coming from deep within the well. Andre walks to the edge of the dark hole. he Mutt Cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate. he next roadsign says DENVER - 157 MILES. Lloyd's feet are now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet should be. Harry looks on the verge of blacking out. he Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background are several tractor-trailer rigs and a caf�. Harry climbs out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the passenger door. he Athletic Beauty   smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and starts to fill her   jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to brush his hair into   place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods to the skis on her   roof-rack. he Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has sidled up to the driver's side. He leans against her side- view mirror. he door opens and Lloyd gets in carrying a bag of Doritos and a soda. He settles into the driver's seat and pulls a Beef Jerky out of his back pocket. hey both stare out the window. he Mutt Cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and Harry is sitting beside it on the pavement, a BROKEN man. he hearse drives past a sign that says ENTERING ASPEN, COLORADO. he boys stroll down the sidewalk, looking in the windows, studying the passersby, taking in the sights and sounds of the ski town. he car is parked in a parking lot across the street from a picturesque bridge. Harry and Lloyd are shivering in the front seat as a LOUD, ICY WIND WHIPS though the hearse. They're each spooning something out of a coffee cup and sipping it. he Bell Captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased. he Bell Captain nods. he Bell Captain, Barnard, is energized by this tip. he Guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse. Several HOTEL EMPLOYEES rush to help them. Harry and Lloyd get out wearing OVERLY TRENDY SKI GARB, complete with fur boots, NASA designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors everywhere. The Employees all grab the shopping bags and then line up as Lloyd TIPS THEM ALL handsomely. he huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies. Lloyd is going through it all. Harry is sitting out on the balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the mountain view. here's a KNOCK on the door. he Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket and a newspaper under his arm. hrongs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange. (THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred dollars. hey ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate J.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face. he guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they make their way to the bar. he Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s. CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to he crowd QUIETS. ANDRE (CONT'D) I'd like to thank you all for coming to this very special event. As you he crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the podium. he crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass. he guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't look very happy. his is when Lloyd notices Harry's get-up. he Waiter shrugs and Lloyd sits down at the empty bar. he chair lift comes back around with Harry still sitting on it, stuck to the bar. Two LITTLE KIDS climb on with him. he two kids just stare at him. he poor Mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously into the lodge as the CROWD BOOS him. he hearse pulls up to the house and stops. he hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out. He's walking up the steps to the house when we hear more GASEOUS THUNDER from his stomach. Harry stops in his tracks, gets his insides under control, and continues to the front porch, where he RINGS the bell. he Reporter shakes her head and they go to a commercial. Mary SHIVERS at this and turns off the television. Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS. She gets up and opens the front door. he Jaguar pulls up in front of the hotel. As Lloyd and Mary get out, we PAN OVER to reveal that they were being followed by Nicholas Andre and J.P. Shay in a Mercedes. he door opens and Lloyd and Mary ENTER. he guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD. here's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her way through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. She flashes an ID. he guys glance guiltily at one another. here's a swarm of ONLOOKERS as Andre and J.P. Shay are hustled into a police car and driven away. While Mary TALKS to the police, Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly. he guys EXIT the hotel and approach the Bell Captain, Barnard. his seems to please Lloyd and Harry. The hearse is delivered to the front door. hey turn to go, but Barnard CALLS TO THEM: he guys are STUNNED by Barnard's generous offer. he guys beam at this."
4,dumb_and_dumber,L,"loyd checks out her body. loyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER! loyd grabs his CB mike. loyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the front oor and RINGS THE BELL. loyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he is speechless. Then: loyd realizes she has a point. loyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her. loyd turns back to the steering wheel. loyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip. loyd starts the limo and pulls away. loyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion of numbers. loyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS. loyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently toward the door of their apartment. loyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still has the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY, tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY. loyd shakes his head. loyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one to him. loyd GRABS THE BRIEFCASE and the two of them EXIT out the window and down the fire escape. loyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries. He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and removes a quarter. loyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN struggles by using a WALKER. loyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters. Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER, AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he sees that loyd looks touched by this. loyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately. loyd flops down in a chair. loyd moves to the window and looks out at the gray, wintry cityscape. loyd turns down the radio. loyd looks out the window guiltily. loyd looks at his friend, incredulous. loyd and Harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables of tough-looking TRUCKERS. Harry oesn't look happy. A middle- aged, no-nonsense WAITRESS approaches their table with a couple of burgers and drinks. She puts them down in front of the boys and starts to walk away. loyd stands and walks over to Sea Bass and his pals. A nervous Harry trails after him. loyd and Harry move away from the table toward the CASHIER. loyd hands the Cashier their check. loyd is driving now while Harry sleeps in the passenger seat. The song, ""Cut Flowers"" by The Smithereens, starts to play as Lloyd FANTASIZES about his future in Aspen. loyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow... loyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her, she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances over her shoulder at him. loyd and Harry are sitting in a large, HEART-SHAPED JACUZZI. Lloyd is sipping a beer and Harry is absorbed in the Enquirer as the water swirls around them. loyd takes a swig of beer. Harry puts down the paper and looks around at the romantic decor. loyd taps Harry's shoulder. loyd immediately taps Harry. loyd shakes his head, defeated. loyd thinks about this. loyd rolls his eyes. loyd looks at Harry. Harry remembers that he's driving. He pulls the car to the side of the road. Mental approaches the passenger window. loyd and Harry are sitting at a table with a hateful Joe Mental. The boys are each holding up a loyd and Harry exchange a look, then simultaneously BITE INTO THE PEPPERS. loyd and Harry who are both sweating profusely now start to GULP down their water. This, of course, makes it burn more. loyd and Harry bite into their food as Joe Mental sits back down at the table. loyd and Harry share a     confused look. Mental shakes his head and BITES INTO HIS     BURGER, CHEWING HEARTILY. Almost immediately, his happy     demeanor is replaced by a LOOK OF HORROR. His FACE TURNS     RED, HE GRABS HIS STOMACH AND FALLS TO THE loyd and Harry are back on the road, looking solemn. loyd is now FAST ASLEEP in the passenger seat as Harry drives on. A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by. Todd Rundgren's ""Too Far Gone"" begins to play while Harry peers at the empty highway INTROSPECTIVELY. As the song plays we see a series of quick shots: loyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him with his foot. loyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet. loyd comes around the   corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO   A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room. When he gets it to the   door, he struggles to lift the engine on it's side, finally   managing to slip the key into the lock. loyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993, 2:15 loyd nods, and as he pulls off the exit, we loyd starts the engine and    pulls out of the parking lot to the nearby freeway entrance.    As he enters the on-ramp, we ZOOM IN on a sign that says:    ROUTE 80 - EAST. He's unwittingly headed BACK IN THE DIRECTION    THEY JUST CAME FROM! loyd shakes his head in amusement, then SNAPS HIS FINGERS in Harry's face. loyd thinks about this and then looks SICKENED. loyd just stands there, SPEECHLESS, as Harry turns and walks away. Out of frustration, he BANGS the snout of the car, causing it to BARK. loyd is driving and Harry has his feet out the window. loyd thinks hard about this. loyd opens a TINY KETCHUP PACKET and squirts half of it into Harry's cup and the other half into his. They pour a few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons. loyd smiles bravely at Harry. Harry notices something and leans toward him. oyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it. Another gust of wind swirls around them. loyd points to the dash. loyd continues to outrun him around the car. Frustrated, Harry opens the car and PULLS THE loyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints at it. loyd looks guilty. loyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE. loyd inspects it more closely. loyd examines the champagne's label and frowns. loyd smiles and over tips him. loyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou. LLOYD Put us down for four plates, my good man. loyd quickly turns toward the bar. loyd takes a big gulp of his new martini. loyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's SPEECHLESS. loyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE. loyd steps back elated. loyd ENTERS the bar as the WAITERS are setting up for the day. loyd GRUNTS a hello. loyd GRUNTS once more. ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D) (big smile) well don't worry, Mercury's supposed to be coming out or retrograde tonight. Things will get better. loyd's now swimming in despair, as the Athletic Beauty RAMBLES ON beside him. loyd motions for the BARTENDER. loyd is sitting forlornly on the bed while Harry feigns surprise at what he's just heard. HARRY It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd. She told me ten o'clock sharp. Are you sure you went to the right bar? loyd BITES HIS LIP at this. He fills two mugs with coffee and throws a splash of Bailey's in each. He check to make sure Harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a BOX OF EX-LAX. loyd hands him the mug with the Ex-Lax. Then he lifts his own glass. loyd is thrilled at this. loyd is in the passenger seat, wearing a subtle, SATISFIED SMILE. An anxious looking Mary is at the wheel. loyd is flustered. He swallows hard. It's the moment of truth. loyd looks at MAry, devastated. loyd and Mary hear a CLICK and turn to see Andre POINTING A GUN at them. Andre steps into the room, and we loyd can't muster a defense. LLOYD Look... I was gonna tell you about that. It was gonna be mentioned at the reading of my will. I swear, you can ask my lawyer. loyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful. loyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunned Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. He reluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted by the turn of events. loyd looks to his friend, confused. Harry opens his shirt, revealing a BULLET-PROOF VEST. loyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid."

Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are focused straight ahead. ental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them. ental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around the bird, who SCREECHES IN ental smiles, and as we PAN to J.P. Shay, we hear a bone- chilling O.S. SNAP and Petey the bird stops SQUAWKING. ental takes out more ANTACID PILLS and starts to chew on them. ental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and WINGS IT DOWN THE STREET as hard as he can. ental puts the phone down and motions the    Anxious Man closer to the booth. The Man moves forward a few    inches. Mental motions him even closer. When he's about a    foot away, Mental punches his hand through the glass of the    booth and knocks the Anxious Man out cold. Then ental picks up the phone again. ental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van. He's joined by J.P. Shay. ental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his mouth. He reaches into his coat pocket and we see a GLINT OF STEEL. Just when he's about to pull the gun out, though, Lloyd hits the breaks and SKIDS to a stop beside a bunch of hitchhiking MIGRANT WORKERS. ental is on the phone outside the front door TALKING to Nicholas Andre. ental pulls a BLACK VIAL OF PILLS out of his jacket. ental starts toward the burger but stops again. MENTAL Doesn't look like you packed much. All I saw was a couple bags... and that briefcase. ental looks at the two of them and realizes that they're serious.

She looks around the outdoor patio for Harry. She spots something and does a DOUBLE- TAKE. ary gets up and stands behind Harry. He MOANS nervously. She grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away from the bar. We see HARRY'S TONGUE STRETCH RIDICULOUSLY... FIVE INCHES... SIX... THEN EIGHT. Harry GROANS in pain. Suddenly, his TONGUE COMES UNDONE and Harry and Mary fall backwards out of the path of J.P. Shay's bullet as it WHIZZES BY. We hear the Mime in the b.g. CRY OUT in pain: ary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings. ary's sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed. She looks at her watch, then flips on the TV. ON THE TUBE - the news is on. A WOMAN REPORTER is addressing the CAMERA gravely: ary's MOUTH DROPS OPEN. ary is torn between getting her briefcase and waiting for Harry. ary looks at Lloyd and smiles. ary is obviously thrown by this question. ary can't believe what's happening. ary ROLLS HER EYES at this. ary sees that they're in deep shit now."

0,american-psycho,BATEMAN,"(V.O.) We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California  place on the Upper East Side. (V.O.)  You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in  a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences  between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van  Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the  best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a  bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten  keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . Or can it be worn with a suit? With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or  charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder  vest. Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out? That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there. Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with  anything? You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah.  You spin a dreidel. No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks. Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all  this? I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a  virus. Maybe it's just the light. What? It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do  enough of it we'll be okay. Calm down. Let's do it anyway That's the spirit. (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks. (V.0.)  My name is Patrick Bateman. I am  twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden  Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh  floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse. (V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a  balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the  morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice  pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand  now. (V.O.)  After I remove the icepack, I use a deep  pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a  water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body  scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. (V.O.)  Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which  I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my  routine. (V.O.) I always use an after-shave lotion with little  or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes  you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye  balm, followed by a final moisturizing ""protective"" lotion... (V.O.)  There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some  kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an  entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold  gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you  and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably  comparable: I simply am not there. (V.O.)  It is hard for me to make sense on any given  level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality  is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is  persistent. (V.0.)  My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared  a long time ago, if they ever did exist. Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages? I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.  Anyone else? When? Negative. Cancel it. Just...say...no. Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols  at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All  right? Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight  tonight. No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks. No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay? Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that  outfit again. I said ""Do not wear that outfit again."" Wear a  dress. A skirt or something. Come on, you're prettier than that. I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels. (V.O.)  I'm trying to listen to the new George  Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fianc�e-keeps buzzing  in my ear. (Removing his Walkman)  Do...what. Evelyn? Is your Evian spiked? No-I can't take the time off work. I don't want to talk about it. Because I...want...to...fit...in. (V.O.)  I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace  since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do,  and relief washes over me in an awesome wave. (After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and  checking his hair)  Hi. Pat Bateman. Let me guess-you live in the East Village? (V.O.) I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn  are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s  usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight  I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use,  though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers,  the biggest dufus in the business. Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important  problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign  policy is important, but there are more pressing problems  at hand. Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow  down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world  hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We  have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We  have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and  oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while  also promoting equal rights for women but change the  abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still  somehow maintain women's freedom of choice. We also have to control the influx of illegal  immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional  moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in  movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have  to promote general social concern and less materialism in  young people. Why don t you just go for Price? He's rich. He's good-looking. He has a great body No. I'm not. Why should I ? It's not. Hello. Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait... you're not giving me valid reasons. What are you trying to say to me? Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee?  Bleach-ee. Oh my God. (Talking over her)  Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question.  Two. (Louder)  Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very  expensive sheets and I really need them clean. If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill  you, are you understanding me? Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting  (Checks Rolex)  at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those  ...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at  Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need  those sheets cleaned by this afternoon. This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with  this. Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ! Hello  (Mumbles un incomprehensible name) Well. Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk  to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere. Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You  know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup? Listen, if you could talk to them  (He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand)  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a  lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes. Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank  you, uh... Victoria? Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the  time. (Checking his watch)  Next Saturday? Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin�e of Les Miserables.  Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call  you. Listen, what are you doing tonight? Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me,  and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to  tonight? On a lot of lithium? You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY  But-when? Am I confused or were we talking about tonight? Pumpkin? Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New  York. Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling  dickweed. Courtney? Dinner? I'm thinking Dorsia. Nice? The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will  you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a  boyfriend to eat there tonight. Eight? Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear  something fabulous. Dorsia, remember? (Both of his eyes are closed)  Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to  reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps? Is that Donald Trump's car? You know, Courtney, you should take some more  lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you  out of this slump. J&B. Straight. Yes. (Examining a menu that says ""Barcadia"" in large script)  Yes, dear. Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter  soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine  called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" You'll  love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and  pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him. Is it a what? I'm ignoring you. (Slowing down but not stopping) What do you want, Courtney? It's a plain end. I think. Oh Jesus. I'm going home. It's a plain end, see? So? Why? Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see,  Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  (He slaps her again lightly)  Why is it pulled down half an inch?  So it can catch the force of the ejaculate! See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch? Lucky, I guess. Uh huh. (Catching Luis hand)  Your compliment was sufficient Luis. I've been great. And you? (V.O.)  Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam.  It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in  fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a  penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.  Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have  a slightly better haircut. (Nervous)  It's...it's...all right. Oh well, you know. Oh yes. I'm very lucky. New card. What do you think? Picked them up from the printers yesterday That's bone. And the lettering is something called  Silian Rail. (Barely able to breath, his voice a croak)  Nice. (V.O.) I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine. (Choking with anxiety)  Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card. (V.O.)  Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness  of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark... (Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman. You want some money?. Some...food? Is this what you need? It's cold out, too, isn't it? (Holding the bill just out of the man's reach)  Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you  get a job? Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it?  Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on  the job? Gee, uh, that's too bad. Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job? You're not what? Qualified for anything else? I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record.  I'm trying to help you. Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who  do have jobs? From people who do work? Listen, what's your name? Speak up. Come on. Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude.  That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together.  I'll help you. (Petting the dog)  Shhhh...it's okay. (Stroking his face, whispering)  Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God. You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  (Shouting) Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of  faggot. Al...I'm sorry. It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common  with you. Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are? There's a quarter. Go buy some gum. (V.O.)  I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood,  skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except  for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside  me and I don't know why. (V.O.)  My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal,  on the verge of frenzy. (V.O.)  I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight? J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer. Not if you want to keep your spleen. Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous  here. Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  (Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood)  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello. Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez  Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana  be at Texarkana? So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the  Fisher account? How did you get it? I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane? Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think  she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams. Another Martini, Paul? (Talking to Owen like a child)  Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check. Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave  a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap? Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  (Helping him into his jacket)  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a  bottle of Absolut waiting for us. You like Huey Lewis and the News? (Said partly from the bathroom)  The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of  consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall.  He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen  from behind ail the time. He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think  Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. Yes, Owen? No, Owen. Yes, it is. In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most  accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is  ""HiP To Be Square,"" a song so catchy that most people probably  don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not  just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of  trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself. crosses the room and picks up the ax. Hey, Paul? (Raising the ax and screaming)  Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking  stupid bastard! (Panting)  Fucking bastard... drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby,  past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment. is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his  feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him. No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken. Commes des Garcon. Jesus lives, Luis. Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans? Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London. Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London  for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.  Hasta la vista, baby. (Faintly irritable)  What is it? (Condescendingly)  Ye-es, Je-an? Who? Tell him I'm at lunch. Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless  phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end. Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion  to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good  buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt  calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties... (Realizing that Kimball is staring at him)  Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent. Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just  walked in... (He laughs inanely)  Just joking... (Pause)  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John,  right, got it.  (He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)  Sorry about that. Oh that? Just mulling over business problems.  Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip. (Shaking firmly)  Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you. (Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)  So, what's the topic of discussion? You're not with the FBI or anything, are you? Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes. Coffee? Perrier? San Pellegrino? Can you bring Mr... Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle- It's no problem Well, what's the topic of discussion? Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the  disappearance or anything... (Trying to laugh)  Not on ""Page Six"" at least. Understandable.  (Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino)  Lime? You sure? I can always get you a lime. Shoot. Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October. Harvard. The Harvard Business School. Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building. (Flattered)  Thanks. Who do you ask? Nuprin? Bad habit. No, I guess it's okay. No problem.  (Buzzing Jean) Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence. Well... I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing,  you know. Yeah...Yale thing. Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet  homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing. He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet. I hope I'm not being cross-examined here. No. Not really. Hang...out? Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular  places. No, he just hung out there. Don't you know this? We were both seven in 1969. Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints? Well, maybe he did, huh? But...has anyone seen him in London? Hmmm. Oh. What? Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced  diet and- Have you consulted a psychic? Had his apartment been burglarized? I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet  or anything, right? That's so typical, isn't it? Nothing. The earth just opens up and swallows people.  (He checks his Rolex) (Standing up)  You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting  with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes. Uh, no. There's one...down here. Yes. It's very good. Absolutely, I'm 100% with you. You like that, slut? You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar  boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white  cotton T-shirt by  Commes des Garcons.  (He snorts like a pig)  My Rolex cost- (Whipering)  I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do  you think of that?  (Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts)  Huh, bitch? I haven't seen you around here. Would you like to see my apartment? Do you want to come to my apartment or not? Do you take American Express? Do you take American Express? I'm joking. Come on, get in. I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does  couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the  American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really  can't stress blonde enough. Blonde. That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking. I want you to clean your vagina. No. From behind. Get on your knees. I want to watch. You have a very nice body. Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry  off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and  our guest in the living room for drinks. You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat.  I'm Paul. How good of you to come. Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm  going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen. So, don't you want to know what I do? Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce.  (Long pause)  Have you heard of it? Actually, that's none of your business, Christie,  hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap. No, no smoking. Not in here. Varda truffle? I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very  fine Chardonnay you're not drinking. Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis  fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before  that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too  artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins'  presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out  another one. I think ""Invisible Touch"" is the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the  same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding  three albums. Christie, take off the robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,  Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance  of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer  songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.  Sabrina, why don't you dance a little? Take the lyrics to ""Land of Confusion."" In this  song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political  authority. ""In Too Deep"" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about  monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting.  Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything  I've heard in rock. Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your  asshole. Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and  therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially  songs like ""In the Air Tonight"" and ""Against  All Odds."" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. But I also think that Phill Collins works better  within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and  I stress the word artist. This is ""Sussudio,"" a great,  great song, a personal favorite. Don't touch the Rolex. We're not through yet... What an asshole. I know her. I knew her. How did you guess? Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy  personality. Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if  they have a good personality?  (He smiles giving up)  I know, I know- Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was  an interesting guy. He said, ""When I see a pretty girl walking down the  street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her  out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat  her right."" What her head would look like on a stick. (Suddenly angry)  Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? ""What about  fucking dinner?"" (Watching Luis going into the men's room)  Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump. Excuse me. (Hissing)  What...is...it? (Stumbling away from him)  I've gotta...I've  gotta...return some videotapes. What? CARRUTHERS  (Silently mouthing the words)  I'll call you. Maybe. Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe. You and...Luis? I never knew you smoked. You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're  going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less. Yes, Courtney? (Flatly)  You too. Yes? Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL  Kimball.  (Extending his hand)  Call me Don. Don. Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You  know. How's the investigation going? Taken anyone  in for ""formal questioning?"" (He makes quotation marks  in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh) Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump. Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need  anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean  Owen was a...complex man. (Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man! I mean-Mon. We be jammin'... (To Daisy)  Ask me a question. What do you think I do? No. Flattering, but no. I m into, well, murders and executions mostly. Welt...it depends, why? So, where do you work out? Leaving what? Don't, I'll drink it. Where to? Are you going to go get a gram? Don't tell me...merchant banking? (laughing)  Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What? Price! Come back! Oh really? DAISY  He said... (She laughs)  He said you gave him bad vibes. That's...that's too bad. What? (insincerely) No. I really don't. doesn't respond. We see that every space on the  puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean  drops the folder on his desk and then walks out. Jean? Would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is...if you're not doing anything. (Lowering his Wayfarers)  Well, isn't this a coincidence. Listen, where should we go? Let's not think about what I want. How about  anywhere you want. No, come on. Anywhere you want. Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere. Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go... Dorsia is...fine. Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at  nine o'clock? Oh really? That's great. Two at nine? Perfect. See you then. Yes? You're dressed...okay. They know me. Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock  for drinks, okay? And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out. Jean? Sorbet? I'm on a diet. But thank you. (Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness)  You can always he thinner. Look...better. No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling  it anyway. So listen, what do you really want to do with your  life? And don't tell me you enjoy working with children,  okay? Do you have a boyfriend? Interesting. Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very  Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape,  twine and a nail gun. Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life? Growing. I'm glad you said that. Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie,  was named Lassie? Had you heard this? Forget it. Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the  nail gun. (Looking up from loading nails into the gun)  What...No! Put it in the carton. Jean? What? I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just  want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special. Yes. I don t think I can...control myself. If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I  think I might hurt you.  (Almost hopefully)  You don't want to get hurt, do you? Thanks. It slipped my mind completely. Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come  into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda? Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  (Hopefully)  Is he a suspect? God...I guess...I was probably returning  videotapes. I had a date with a girl named Veronica. What? Well...I...Wait...What information have  you received? Well, I could he wrong. (Clearly nervous and under pressure)  We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It  was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner  at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I  physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't  remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's. Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long  day-a bit scattered. Great, yes, I'd like that. Absolutely. I'm with you on that one. Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers. No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me. I'll be there. Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise. Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. Nothing like last time, promise. (Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)  So, you're looking great, how have you been? (Mock shock)  Really? Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here. Bitch. Uh uh uh. Half now, half later. Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine,  Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.  You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything  about yourself. Is that clear. Christie? (Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment)  It's not that nice. What do you mean, she was a hot number. She's my...cousin. She's from...France. Elizabeth, it's three in the morning. Don't tell him you're here. (Whispering)  You're at Paul Owen s. (Whispering)  Paul Owen. No. Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.  What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free. Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive? Come on. I think it would be a turn-on. Christie, you're not drinking your wine. (To Elizabeth)  Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl? Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP  called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles  on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps  across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's  mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album  on a first listening. (Ignoring her)  It's hard to choose a favorite track  among so many great ones, but ""The Greatest Love of All""  is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about  self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message  crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope  that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder.  Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in  to empathize with others, we can always empathize with  ourselves. It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's  beautifully stated on the album. Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you  piece of bitch trash! I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch. (Speaking very carefully, measuring each word)  My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale  cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill  my needs. We need to talk. It's over, Evelyn. It's all over I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This  is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore. (Brushing her hand away)  I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about  that. You can have them. Yes, I am. We never really shared one. I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  (He pauses, as if searching for the right words)  You're just not terribly important to me. I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes. (Looking uncomfortably around the room)  If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making  this scene right now. I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going. I'm just leaving. I have to return some videotapes. Here kitty, kitty. Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my  lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of  people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some  homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in  Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin'  Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail  gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I  killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost  got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I  can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed  Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving  in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything  out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes  of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even... well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little.  Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not  sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess  I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show  up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open. Not in the mood, I guess. (Deliberately nonchalant)  Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them. I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some  sorbet? But how? Where do you place Paul that night? And? Marcus? But Marcus denied it? Well, does Marcus have an alibi? He does? You're sure? Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?  (He laughs) (Laughing with him)  Where was Marcus? So who was he with? Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen  to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner  with Victoria...the following night. 20B. Mrs. Wolfe? No. I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place. Doesn't he live here? Are you sure? No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here? But I think...I want to know what happened  here. I won't...don't worry. Jean? Hello? Jean? Hello? Jean, I need help! Jean-I'm not- Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch? What are I doing? I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean. ...to the office this afternoon. (Screaming)  Just...say...no! Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus! (On automatic)  I'm not going anywhere unless we  have a reservation. (He downs his drink)  Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously. Shut up, Carnes, they will not. So, Harold, did you get my message? (Waving smoke out of his face)  Yes, naturally. What exactly do you mean? But wait, Harold, what do you mean? Carnes? Wait. What are you talking about? Bateman is what? (Desperate, shouting)  Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really  comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes.  I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off.  I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your  machine was true. No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm  Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time!  Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer. Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed  Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible? Why not, you stupid bastard? No, you...didn't? I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  (To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal.  Working for UNICEF now? (V.O.)  But inside doesn't matter... Whatever. (V.O.) There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with  the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil,  all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward  it, I have now surpassed... (V.O.) My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better  world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on  others. I want no escape. (V.O.) But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no  deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted  from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any  of this. This confession has meant nothing..."
1,american-psycho,B,"ased on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis ateman throws a swizzle stick at him. rilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a  black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels.  MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls  stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the  counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as  women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they  wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple  lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes  past them and slams the door. ateman opens a tiny packet of coke. ateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts. ateman saunters toward the bar as ""Pump Up the Volume""  plays in the background. ateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her  a $50. ateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to  see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his  toilet. ateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face. ateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living  room wearing the ice pack. ateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a  gel facial masque. ateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is  stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He  begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in  readiness on the marble counter. ateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried,  giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been  wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque  off his face. ateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling  his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive,  wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him. ateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television. ateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get  Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the  Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally,  he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to  look around him at the TV, then takes notice. ateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television. ateman, dressed in an Armani suit  with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry  cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the  counter. ateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the  counter. ateman is on the verge of tears. ateman turns to leave. ateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes  out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound  of the bell on the closing door. ateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to  Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one  hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear  the sounds of the porn movie as he talks. ateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the  number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so  he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with  his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there  is finally an answer. ateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is heavily medicated. ateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her. ateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face. ateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom. ateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in  the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto  a spectacular view of Manhattan. ateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card. ateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to  control his anxiety. ateman stares at his own card and then enviously at  McDermott's. ateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of  $500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns  to leave, he notices someone across the street. ateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet. ateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street.  Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the  body left twitching on the ground. ateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the  MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his  nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly. ateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning  bed, wearing goggles. ateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'. ateman nods, agitated. ateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the shower. He takes two Valium. ateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its  case and slides it in the machine. ateman puts on ""Hip To Be Square."" lood sprays onto the white raincoat. lood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor. ateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the  coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly  over the back of a chair. ateman gets into the cab. ateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in  a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the  body dissolve. ateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very  similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls  are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting  on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale  scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch. ateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of  Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing  Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes  the Walkman off. ateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in  exasperation. ateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down  in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters  and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched  glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman.  He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves. ateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a  bottle of aspirin. ateman leads him to the door. ateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his  eyes and leans against the door, sweating. ateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand,  jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing. ateman hangs up, frustrated. ateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside  CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket.  Bateman opens his window to speak to her. ateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a  tuxedo. ateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now  notices, then takes. ateman answers the door. ateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a  glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the  couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a  long silence. ateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs. ateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a  pack of cigarettes out of her purse. Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates. ateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection.  He takes one out and examines it. ateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to  put it on. ateman starts to undress. ateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather  menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves. ateman looks through the viewfinder. ateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina  on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his  wrist. Bateman's eyes open. ateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire. ateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They  are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a  deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the  b.g. Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" is playing. ateman pulls on his gloves as he  enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his  back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman  approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands  up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his  neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear  is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to  squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around. ateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift  his hands again, but abandons the attempt. ateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are  still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and  stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he  realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up  behind him. ateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter  and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d'  and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely,  Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at  them. Carruthers walks up behind him. ateman storms out of the restaurant. ateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex.  Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels  something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy,  a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence. ateman is making final adjustments to his tie. ateman gasps and recovers. ateman is nodding nervously, idiotically. ateman shakes his head. ateman wanders away. ateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a  more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in  black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott  and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black  mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered  argument. ateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his  drink. ateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses  in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the  case. ateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York  Times crossword puzzle at dusk. ateman nods without looking up. ateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles  at her. ateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady  visible. ateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in  his hand and hands her the sorbet. ateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge  of the blade. ateman picks up the duct tape. ateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside  the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with  Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for  a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting  the door behind him. ateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified. ateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses. Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at  the floor. There is an awkward silence. ateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares  At Christie while she waits for someone to answer. ateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the whole glass, making a face. ateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her  another glass of the drugged wine. ateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind  Christie. There is blood on his face. ateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw,  spattered with blood. oth are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood. ateman runs after her. ateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw. ateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on  the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the  chainsaw in her back. ateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat. ateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming  to the floor. ateman ducks down an alley. ateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of  them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He  reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving. ateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the  police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light  up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living  and dead. ateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the  revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he  notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He  revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor. ateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs  in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close  behind him. ateman stands looking out  through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view  of the city and the river. elow him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the  opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares  everywhere, distant sirens. ateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight  circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises  up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the  sky. ateman looks at him in silence,  panicking. ateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He  has a surgical mask in one hand. ateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly  painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English  country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There  are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands  admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman  wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops  at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He  opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs.  Wolfe approaches, smiling. ateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other. ateman backs away slowly. ateman enters the revolving  door of an office building, panicking and breathing  heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks  deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes  out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY  just like him. ateman looks up at him wild-eyed. ateman searches his pockets  for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows  them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his  face, dialing a number. ateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the  previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking  and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down,  still breathing heavily. ateman sits down silently. ateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses. ateman approaches, trying to act casual. ateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze. They are all looking at the television, where Ronald  Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are  halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's  lying. ateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look. ateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs."
2,american-psycho,T,"he camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins: he Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately  decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's  description of each of the men at the table. he others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap down on the table. he men sit in shocked, horrified silence. he limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel.  McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN,  who looks confused. he man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine,  unhooks the  velvet rope and welcomes them inside. he GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate  voice: hey both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope  of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking  their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into  their gums. he music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is  smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively. ableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light.  A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows  looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist  high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large  Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive  electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly  impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of  a design magazine. he phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave. he taxi bumps to a halt. m Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are  already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen,  with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with  ragged black hair and bad skin. hey are all trying to read large stainless steel menus  that look like minimalist art. hey exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back,  Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck. he table stares at Bateman uncomfortably. he woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing  his smile, smiles back. he woman continues to speak to him in another language,  grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket. he cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads  ""Barcadia."" heir conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's  thoughts. hey all lean forward to inspect it. he financial district. The streets are eerily deserted. he Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up. he Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches  into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his  mind and holds out a $5 instead. he Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose. he dog starts to whimper. he Waiter leaves. his place is hot, very hot. here is a long disgruntled silence. he end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the  table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid  down. he door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD  KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age -  and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of  the type Bateman and his friends might wear. hey laugh politely. he living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal  crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw  Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table,  next to a copy of GQ. he person on the other end clearly hangs up. he doorman RINGS. Bateman answers. he escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes  her coat and inspects her body and face. he two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles.  Christie shrugs. he man stares at him. he man walks by, shaking his head. he club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a  balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him  in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over  the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman  is reaching for him. he same street corner where Bateman found Christie before.  The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a  half-opened window. he driver's here, you'll be safe. he living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped  down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an  attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally.  Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to  examine a CD. he kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and  putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth  is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars. hey run through the bedroom and into the bathroom.  Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the  bathtub. he woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly. he occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed. he small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and  walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in  the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT. Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the  deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He  takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the  kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him. he cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air.  Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire. he guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down  the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage  cans, etc. hey all laugh. he SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts: he conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone. he sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs  over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking  on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of  other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking  on portable phones, talking, laughing, he camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him:  ""THIS IS NOT AN EXIT."""
3,american-psycho,KIMBALL,"nods understandingly. No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  (Gesturing toward the phone)  Was that anything important? (Holding out his hand)  Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed  to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well,  you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get. stares at the three open copies of Sports  Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk.  Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines  into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is  still running. I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate  the disappearance of Paul Owen. Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator. So it's nothing that official. I just have some  basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself- No. I'm okay. No, I'm okay. takes out a small black notepad and the same gold  Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes  Jean. KIMBALL. Oh no, I'm okay. The disappearance of Paul Owen. I think his family wants this kept quiet. No, really. I'm okay. Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own  files, okay? How old are you? (Scribbling in his notebook)  Where did you go to school? Your address? (Looking up, impressed)  Nice. Very nice. Pardon me, but are you okay? You seem...nervous. I know. I'm sorry. Would you rather I not smoke? You sure? What can you tell me about Paul Owen? How well did you know him? Yale thing? What do you mean...Yale thing? So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul  Owen? What kind of man was he? Besides... (He hesitates tries to smile)  the information you've just given. Do you feel that way? (As he writes without looking up)  Where did Paul hang out? Yeah. You know...hang out. He had a yacht? And where did he go to school? I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN  Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help. I understand. Anything else you can tell me about Owen? (Smiles)  So was I. Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he  went to London. His girlfriend doesn't think so. Actually, yes. Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification.  A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but  I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert  Ainsworth for Paul, so... Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship? I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I  know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't  know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was  recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano  girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts- Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing. No. No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A  suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it. No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything. It's just strange.  (He stares out the window, lost in thought)  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive,  and then... People just...disappear. Eerie. Really eerie. Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I  mean aren't you going to be late? Oh really? I didn't know that. turns to face him. Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information  at all... Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman. Mr. Bateman? So...you hang out here a lot? 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli? (Looking at his glass)  Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much  more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting,  don't you think? Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli? I mean they want to get caught. I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's  taken a leave of absence. Not really. Do you remember where you were on the night of  Paul's disappearance?  (He checks his notebook)  Which was on the twentieth of December? Wait. That's not what I've got. That's not the information I've received. Let's see... (He flips through his notebook)  That you were with- Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen? Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman. Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch  in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information? And if you could try and pin down where you were  the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a  lot easier. Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I  just bought it on my way here. Not a big music fan, eh? Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll  call your secretary about reservations. and Bateman are sitting at a corner table. (Very surprised)  No hash browns? But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I  mean- it's-have you been here before? (Looking at him like he's nuts)  Suit yourself, I guess. So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on  what you did? I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up. According to his date book, and this was verified by his  secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam. I've questioned him. Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't  be sure. Yes. Yes. (smiling) I checked it out. It's clean. He wasn't with Paul  Owen. He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,  Harry Newman, George Butner and �  (He pauses, Then looks up)  - you. Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for  a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking.  Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or  later.  (A pause)  I mean, to think that one of his friends  killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too  ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?"
4,american-psycho,M,"ary Harron and Guinevere Turner cDERMOTT  What do you mean? cDERMOTT  Well, is it strictly informal- cDERMOTT  (Smiling)  Exactly cDERMOTT  But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look  too studied. cDERMOTT  (Staring at retreating waiter)  Did he just take our plates away? cDERMOTT  Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head. (He guffaws) cDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses. cDERMOTT  Is that Reed Robinson over there? PRICE  Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson. cDERMOTT  Who is it then? cDERMOTT  Who is he with? cDERMOTT  Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there? cDERMOTT  He's handling the Fisher account. cDERMOTT  Lucky Jew bastard. cDERMOTT  Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The  bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December. cDERMOTT  Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes? cDERMOTT  Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the  ACLU. cDERMOTT  Only $470. cDERMOTT  Last week I picked up this Vassar chick- cDERMOTT  But I never told you what happened afterwards. So  okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big  tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I  buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on  spring break and she's practically blowing me in the  Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place- cDERMOTT  Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick  who's gonna let me- cDERMOTT  You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op  together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some  chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes. cDERMOTT  Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to  this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking  rhino tipsy, and get this- cDERMOTT  This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She  would only-are you ready?  (Dramatic pause)  She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept  her glove on. cDERMOTT  I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask  him if he takes American Express. cDermott and Price enter. cDERMOTT  Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account. cDERMOTT (Whispering)  I think he's lying. cDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully. cDERMOTT  Whoa. Very nice. Take a look. cDERMOTT  (Envious)  Silian Rail? cDERMOTT  Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a  fucking drug addict. No self-control. cDERMOTT  Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it  like that? cDERMOTT  So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a  babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other  reason. cDERMOTT  If they have a good personality and they are not  great looking-who fucking cares? cDERMOTT  Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even  talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly  chicks. cDERMOTT  And this is because they have to make up for how  fucking unattractive they are. cDERMOTT  So what did Ed say? cDERMOTT  What does the other part of him think? cDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back  at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily join In. cDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table. cDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you  know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly. cDERMOTT  Ah, cheer up, Bateman.  (Slaps him on the back, massages his neck)  What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning? cDERMOTT  Whoa, hold on there, little buddy. cDERMOTT  Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder.  You went last time. Stay here. cDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears. Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring  into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to  unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help. cDermott and Daisy walk up to them. cDERMOTT  Hey-don't worry, be happy. cDermott stops by the table. cDERMOTT  KIMBALL! How's the investigation?  Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says.  (Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back)  Bateman, what's wrong with ,you? cDERMOTT  You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky  without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a  raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long.  (He wanders off muttering)  No fucking hash browns... rs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the  surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes. rs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall,  rattled, and gets into the elevator. cDERMOTT  Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough  day at the office? cDERMOTT  Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking  Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't  get a reservation to save his life. cDERMOTT  Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them. cDERMOTT  He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless. Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that  shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know,  what can I say? cDERMOTT  Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water? cDERMOTT  (Bored) Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually  listening to you."

6,american-psycho,PRICE,"Yes. Clarify. You'll look like you consciously worked for the look. It looks that way, doesn't it? He took them away because the portions are so small he  probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place.  This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia? That's Paul Owen.

They don't know that. Prove it. I'm shaking. You open it. Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it? Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?

0,indiana_jones_raiders,I,"n the undergrowth, there is slithering movement. ndian #1 draws aside a branch and is faced with a horrific  stone sculpture of a Chachapoyan demon. The Indian is so  frightened no sound comes out when he screams. He turns and  runs silently away. ndian #2 calls to his friend. Getting no response, he steps  in that direction. A huge macaw, flushed from the undergrowth,  screams and flies away. Indian #2 does exactly the same thing,  never to be seen again. ndy, Satipo and Barranca, just clearing the trees, look  back in that direction. They all turn to face the Temple. t is dark and awesome. Vegetation curls from every crevice,  over each elaborate frieze. The entrance - round, open and  black - has been designed to look like open jaws. ndy takes the weird feather from the band of his hat. From  around its point, he slips a tightly rolled piece of  parchment. Barranca and Satipo exchange a quick ""So that's  where is was!"" look. They all kneel as Indy spreads out the  parchment. On it is one-half of a crude floorplan of the  Temple. ndy fixes them with an expectant stare. Satipo produces a  similar, but folded, piece of parchment. He lays it - the  other half of the floorplan - next to Indy's. They all regard  it for a moment, then Indy stands and walks toward the Temple.  Barranca's eyes are shining as they dart between the floorplan  and Satipo. ndy's next move is amazing, graceful and fast, yet totally  unhurried. His right hand slides up under the back of his  leather jacket and emerges grasping the handle of a neatly  curled bullwhip. With the same fluid move that brings Indy's  body around to face the Peruvian, the whip uncoils to its  full ten foot length and flashes out. ndy gives the whip a short pull and Barranca's arm in jerked  down, where it involuntarily discharges the gun into the  dirt. Barranca is amazed, but feels some slack in the whip  and immediately raises the gun toward Indy again, cocking it  with his free hand. ndy's face goes hard. And sad. ndy sweeps his arm in a wide arc. Barranca spins around,  enclosed in the whip, his gun hand stuck tight against his  body. Indy gives one more short jerk on the whip handle and  Barranca's gun fires. Barranca falls dead. ndy looks quickly at Satipo, who is shocked and frightened.  He raises his arms in supplication. ndy looks him over, then nods. He frees the whip from  Barranca's body and picks up the man. His eyes sweep the  surrounding woods. ndy and Satipo, carrying a torch, walk up the slightly  inclined, tubular passage from the main entrance. The interior  is wet and dark, hanging with plant life and stalactites.  Their echoing footsteps intermittently overpower the sounds  of loud dripping, whistling air drafts and scampering claws. ndy leads the way down a twisting hallway, Satipo's torch  barely lighting his way from behind. Indy disappears in a  shadow and when he reappears a moment later a huge black  tarantula is crawling up the back of his jacket. Indy doesn't  notice and disappears into another shadow, emerging with two  more tarantulas on his back. ndy begins picking up little pocket-sized artifacts from  the niches and ledges of the Temple. He continues to do this  as the men penetrate the Temple. His collecting is quick and  expert, evaluating the pieces in an instant, discarding some,  stuffing others into his clothes, and never stopping his  forward progress. ndy picks up a stick and throws it through the shaft of  light. Giant spikes spring together from the sides of the  chamber with a ferocious CLANG! And impaled on the spikes  are the remains of a white man, half-fleshed, half skeleton,  in explorer-type grab. Indy reaches out and takes hold of  the man's carcass. As the spikes slowly retract, Indy pulls  it free and seats the remains gently on the floor. ndy steps sideways into the chamber. His back pressed against  the very points of the retracted spikes, he moves along the  edge of the light beam, and steps clear on the other side.  Satipo grimaces and begins sweating his way through. ndy and Satipo come down stone stairs to a tight landing.  Framing the entry are a carefully strung network of dead  vines, each somehow hooked into the wall, narrowing the  opening even more. ndy stands still looking at the hall. ndy swings his whip across the floor. Fifteen feet of it  cuts open beneath the lash, falling away to reveal black pit  as wide as the hall. The illusory floor was made of dust- covered cobwebs. Satipo picks up a stone and drops it down  the pit. No sound. The two men exchange glances. Indy looks  up at the high roof of the hall. He swings the whip up around  a support beam, tests its strength with a pull and swings  over the pit on the whip. From the other side he swings the  whip back to Satipo, who throws Indy the torch. Satipo swings  across. When they are both standing on solid floor there is  a moment of quiet in which they hear, from far, far below -  SPLASH! Indy wedges the whip handle into the wall and leaves  it strung to the beam for quick retreat. ndy kneels and uses the unlit end of the torch to reach out  and tap a white tile. It is solid. He taps a black tile.  There is a whizzing sound and a tiny dark sticks in the torch.  Satipo points to the wall nearby: there is a recessed hole  there. ndy nods, stands and looks around the sanctuary. The entire  room is honey-comed with the same kind of hole. Satipo sees  it too and is properly impressed. ndy reaches the altar. The tiny idol looks both fierce and  beautiful. It rests on a pedestal of polished stone. Indy  looks the whole set-up over very carefully. From his jacket  he takes a small, canvas drawstring bad. He begins filling  it with dirt from around the case of the altar. When he has  created a weight that he thinks approximates the weight of  the idol, he bounces it a couple times in his palm  concentrating. It's clear he wants to replace the idol with  the bag as smoothly as possible. His hand seems ready to do  that once, when he stops, takes a breath and loosens his  shoulder muscles. Now he sets himself again. And makes the  switch! The idol is now in his hand, the bag on the pedestal.  For a long moment it sits there, then the polished stone  beneath the bag drops five inches. This sets off an AURAL  CHAIN REACTION of steadily increasing volume as some huge  mysterious mechanism rumbles into action deep in the temple. ndy spins and starts his kata back across the sanctuary at  four times the speed. ndy hesitates, eyeing the rumbling walls. ndy concurs with that assessment. He tosses the idol across  the pit to Satipo. Satipo stuffs it in the front pocket of  his jacket, gives Indy a look, then drops the whip on the  floor and runs. ndy grimaces. He had a feeling this might happen. He looks  around. ndy runs in full stride to the edge of the pit and broad  jumps into space. He doesn't make it. His body hits the far  side of the pit and he begins to slide out of view. Only  wild clawing with his fingers at the edge of the pit stops  his descent. With just the tips of his fingers over the edge,  he begins pulling himself up. ndy sails through sideways and rolls to a stop at the bottom  of the steps. His whip is grasped in his hand. As he raises  himself, he hears, from above the giant spikes of the Chamber  of Light CLANG! and an abrupt, sickening rendition of SATIPO'S  LAST SCREAM. Indy runs up the steps. The rumbling sound grows  louder. ndy slides to a stop. The spikes have retracted, taking  Satipo's body to one side. Indy edges into the chamber with  his back to the shaft of light. Soon he is face to face with  the dead Satipo; spikes protrude from several vital spots in  the Peruvian's body. Indy removes the idol from Satipo's  pocket and moves quickly out the other side. ndy shoots out of a cut-off hallway and turns toward the  exit. The rumbling is very loud and now we see why: right  behind Indy a huge boulder comes roaring around a corner of  the passage, perfectly form-fitted to the passageway. It  obliterates everything before it, sending the stalactites  shooting ahead like missiles. Indy dashes for the light of  the exit. His hat flies off his head. Almost immediately it  is crushed by the boulder. Indy dives out the end of the  passage as the boulder slams to a perfect fit at the entrance,  sealing the Temple. ndy lies on the ground, gasping for air. A shadow falls  across him and he looks up. ndy is immediately up and running toward the edge of the  clearing. ndy disappears into the foliage. An instant later, the leaves  are peppered with a rain of poison darts and spears. ndy runs like hell through steadily falling terrain. And  always close behind, a swift gang of angry Hovitos.  Occasionally they get close enough to send a dart or spear  whizzing past Indy's head. ndy relaxes and lies across the seat, a big smile on his  face. One hand drops to the floor of the cabin and Indy jumps,  hitting his head. On the floor of the cabin is a huge boa  constrictor. Indy tries to get his whole body onto the seat.  Jock sees what's happening. t soars off over the dark jungle. t's autumn and the pretty, New England campus out Indy's  window reflects it in dazzling color. A few weeks before the  start of classes. Activity just picking up. Some students  about. ndy is at a bookcase near the window and he looks quite  different in this setting. His outfit is tweedy, slightly  rumpled in the professional style. Part of his attention is  focused in a book and he wears glasses to see the fine print.  The office is cramped, absolutely inundated with books, maps,  etchings and archeological artifacts. In fact, the only neat  spot in the room right now is Indy's desk, which has been  cleared off expressly for the benefit of - ndy snaps the book closed and puts it on the shelf. He takes  his glasses off and focuses on Brody. At the windowed door  to his office, two pretty Coeds pause for a moment, look in  at their sexy Archeology professor, giggle and disappear. ndy's course - a combination of archeology and anthropology -  is taught in this amphitheater-type lecture hall. His desk  and lectern hold large reference books; blackboards line the  wall. Bones, maps, charts festoon the walls. ndy leans against his desk talking with Brody and two  uniformed Army officers, COLONEL MUSGROVE and MAJOR EATON,  who are situated around the first seats in the classroom. ndy contemplates this big news; he's impressed. ndy moves to the blackboard and makes a quick sketch to  give a rough idea of the system as he describes it. (and we  get a glimpse of what an interesting and enthusiastic teacher  he must be). ndy pulls a big format book from the stack on his lectern  and flips through the pages until he finds a large color  print. The other men gather to look. t shows a Biblical battle. The Israelite Army is vanquishing  an opposition force. At the forefront of the Israelite ranks,  two men carry the Ark of the Covenant, a beautiful gold chest,  crowned by two sculptured gold angels. The men do not touch  the Ark itself; rather they carry it by use of two long wooden  poles which pass through rings in the corners of the Ark.  The painting is very dramatic, full of smoke, tumult and  sinewy dying men. But the most astounding thing in the picture  is the brilliant jet of white light and flame issuing from  the wings of the angels. It pierces deep into the ranks of  the retreating enemy, wreaking devastation and terror. ndy's English Tudor, upper middle class home. Quite toney;  well beyond the financial reach of an honest college  professor. Marcus Brody has already rung the bell. Indy opens  the door. He is dressed in a tuxedo. ndy's manner is vigorous, aggressive. ndy is barely into the front seat of a dilapidated Ford as  the driver, BUZZ KEHOE, is peeling out into traffic. In the  back seat is a Chinese named BANG CHOW. Kehoe zigs crazily  through traffic with only his left hand as he reaches over  to shake with Indy. ndy arrives at his destination. The lovely, carved gold  section of the headpiece is nested on purple velvet in a  glass case. At the bottom of the piece is a round hollow  where the staff would fit. There is a grunting sound behind  Indy and he spins, already reaching for his revolver. ndy and the Samurai face each other. They're both breathing  hard from previous, no-contact passes at each other. Now  Indy begins swinging the whip over his head again. It whizzes  out toward the Samurai's face. The Samurai takes two lightning- quick cuts at the leather, but misses. Indy swings for the  Samurai's feet; the Japanese jumps nimbly, slashing at the  whip. Indy does it again. The Samurai hops it. Once more.  The Samurai is concentrating on hopping it. ndy sees it. The split second he wants. The whip flashes up  from the floor and wraps solidly and irrevocably around the  Samurai's neck. Indy gives it a murderous pull and the Samurai  is dead on his feet. ndy is at the case containing the headpiece. He smashes the  glass with a samurai sword, reaches in and grabs the piece.  Immediately, behind him, the huge hammer falls and the sound  of the gong thunders through the museum. ndy looks above him, sees the giant disk of the gong.  Reaching up, pushing with tremendous effort, he maneuvers it  off the hook. It bounces down to the floor on its side,  chipping the marble with its monstrous weight. Indy steadies  it and then puts his whole body into rolling it across the  room toward the window. As it starts to roll, Indy slips  behind it and runs across the room with it. ndy lands in a shower of glass on the jutting roof of the  museum's first floor. He rolls to a crouch and is immediately  being fired upon. The Germans, cut off from the museum, are  standing on the palace walkway firing at him. Indy takes off  fast for the rear of the museum. ndy squirms his way down into the front seat. n a corner near the fireplace trouble breaks out suddenly  between the groups at two neighboring tables. Ferocious  representatives from each table - one a wild-looking SHERPA,  the other a muscular Australian CLIMBER - jump up to face  each other. As the two contenders stand poised for action,  their respective supporters shift in their places, fondling  lethal ice axes and clubs. ndy's attitude changes instantly. This is sad news. He is  silent for a long time. Mahdlo comes in the front door and  hurries forward when he sees Indy with Marion. He looks to  her for guidance, but she stays him with a gesture. ndy looks at her, thinking. Under his gaze, she blushes,  for reasons only she understands. She looks into her glass  and, for a moment, she softens. ndy takes a long time to answer. ndy releases her arms. ndy feels tired, defeated. Marion is pleased. ndy has to smile at her glee. ndy nods, gets up to go. ndy thinks about this a moment, then reaches inside his  shirt and pulls cash from a money belt. He lays five grand  on the bar. ndy starts for the door. Marion takes another think. She is  getting high. ndy looks into her eyes, then leans over the bar and kisses  her deeply. When the kiss ends, their faces are very close.  Marion is flushed. She liked it and would like more. She  raises her glass between them to discipline herself. ndy smiles and walks to the front door. Then, without looking  back - ndy sits thinking at the wheel of an old car. Finally, he  puts the car in gear and drives away. ndy is in a crouch behind a table, trying to get a shot at  someone. He doesn't notice in the din and confusion when the  door bursts open. An incredible, fearsome GIANT SHERPA, almost  seven feet tall, soars in and tackles Indy from behind. The  whip flies from Indy's hand as he and the Giant Sherpa roll  across the floor, upsetting furniture. ndy smashes a chair over the head of the Giant Sherpa and  the huge creature goes down. ndy moves quickly through the flames, his eyes scanning the  floor. He picks up his bullwhip and his crumpled felt hat.  He peers through the smoke till he spots Marion moving among  the burning furniture. ndy and Marion have been welcomed like family into the  crowded home of SALLAH, his wife FAYAH, and their NINE  CHILDREN (ages 4 - 18). Fayah, a huge, imposing woman,  appears, at first glance, to be the power in the house.  Sallah, a small, cheerful, energetic fellow in his forties  defers to his wife in all matters of little importance.  Suddenly the general liveliness at the children's table  escalates into pandemonium, attracting the attention of the  adults. ndy and Sallah sit in the small, protected courtyard. Sallah  holds the two sections of the headpiece, the medallion and  the base, and has for the first time fitted them together.  They fit perfectly and complete the headpiece. He peruses  the markings on the headpiece quizzically. Indy is cleaning  and loading a .45 automatic. ndy reacts. ndy and Marion are briskly walking along one of Cairo's  busy bazaar streets. Vendors with fine cloth, pottery,  baskets, jewelry, etc line the street. Marion has the Monkey  from Sallah's house on her shoulder. ndy and Marion are passing under a balcony where a lone  GERMAN AGENT stands watch. After they pass, the Agent nods  to some BAD ARABS who are hiding in the shadows of the street.  In a moment, Indy and Marion pass by the break. Monkey Man  turns and looks up at a roof further down the alley. He waves  with his hand. Someone up there waves back. ndy and Marion have reached a tiny square, made even more  cramped by its use as a small bazaar. They have started  working their way through the crowd when several Bad Arabs  and a German Agent begin to converge on them. Indy immediately  sees what's happening and pulls the bull whip from his jacket.  The first Bad Arab to reach them gets hit in the mouth by  the handle of the whip. Now all hell breaks loose, with Bad  Arabs, Innocent Shoppers, baskets of fruit and tables of  goods flying every which way in the constricted space. ndy catches a dagger-wielding Bad Arab around the legs with  the whip and flips him. Marion is reluctant to leave Indy. ndy ducks under the swinging blade of a huge Arabian sword  and kicks the Bad Arab Swordsman in the groin. ndy has heard her. He looks across the square as the basket  and its escorts disappear beyond a building. One last Bad  Arab rises before him. Indy's whip flashes and the Bad Arab's  robe falls down to his ankles. Indy frantically pushes his  way through the panicked mass of humanity in the direction  the basket has gone. ndy rounds the corner and is immediately driven back by  machine gun fire. Taking cover, he gets quick, intermittent  glimpses of this scene: At the far corner of the large,  deserted square is a canvas-covered truck. Two Bad Arabs are  hurrying toward is with a large rattan basket between them,  Marion screaming inside. A German Agent is covering their  retreat with a machine gun from the cab of the truck. Indy  runs up to see the rattan basket being heaved into the back  of the truck. ndy, blown back across the square, looks on, astounded and  horror-stricken. ndy knows its true; that's what's tearing him up. ndy sits, glancing at the German Henchmen, who settle nearby,  just out of earshot. ndy registers this as he takes a drink. Belloq watches him  with disdainful amusement. ndy takes a drink. ndy stands up. The German Henchmen and poised. Belloq eyes  the Arab patrons and signals for the Henchmen to relax. ndy climbs into the cab of Sallah's truck with a smiling  Sallah as the children pile into the back. Sallah pulls out. ndy looks back there, nods. ndy, nervous, goes back to the food tray, picks up another  date. When he turns back to the men, the Monkey's paw grabs  another date. ndy, still holding the date, exchanges a long look with  Sallah. ndy hoots. Then he takes the data in his hand and flips it  high in the air. He opens his mouth to catch it, but it  doesn't come down. He has inadvertently thrown it into a  bowl of a hanging lamp. This makes the men laugh even harder. ndy goes over and picks up another date. He turns laughing  to Sallah and doesn't see as the Monkey's paw comes up,  slowly, takes another date and begins to withdraw. Suddenly  the paw is stricken with palsy and the unseen Monkey goes  into its death throws. Sallah watches the paw as though  hypnotized. Finally the paw slips from sight and we hear a  solid THUMP! on the floor. Sallah walks around the table and  looks at the floor. The Monkey lies dead among a mess of  date pits. ndy is in a happy world of his own. He throws his date high  in the air. He positions himself under it and waits for it  to drop in. Here it comes. Right on target. As it's about to  disappear into Indy's mouth, Sallah's hand flashes in and  grabs it. Indy looks mystified and disappointed. Sallah  motions toward the dead Monkey. ndy and Sallah are lying in classic shouting fashion at the  top of the rise looking down on the Tanis Digs. Down behind  them, Sallah's truck is parked with the three Arab Diggers. ndy and Sallah move stealthily among the tents. Indy carries  a smooth wooden staff almost seven feet tall. They stop  between two tents and look across a path at the entrance to  the map room. What appeared to be a mound of dirt is actually  the roof on the ancient building. The hole/entrance is a  five-foot square skylight. Indy looks around, then walks  casually to the edge of the hole and looks inside. Sallah  joins him, producing a length of rope from his robes. Indy  drops the staff into the unseen map room as Sallah ties the  rope around on oil drum. When it's secure, Indy wastes no  time disappearing down it into the map room. ndy is down the twenty feet to the floor of the room in  seconds. He tugs on the rope and it immediately gets pulled  up. Indy looks around with real wonder and excitement. The  room is lovely, with elaborate wall carvings and frescoes,  all lit by the bright stream of sunlight flooding in from  above. This beam of light leads Indy's eye to the far end,  and the room's truly remarkable feature: built into the floor  in meticulous relief is a miniature stone model of the ancient  city of Tanis. Already, the sunlight has worked its way down  the far wall and is edging onto the miniature of the city.  On the floor, to the skylight side of the miniature, is an  elaborate line created by embedded mosaic tiles. The evenly  spaced slots in the line, each accompanied by a symbol of a  time of year, are for the base of the staff. Indy pulls the  headpiece from his robes - it has been welded together - and  reaches for the staff. ndy is examining the results of Belloq's work. Red paint  marks one of the miniature buildings in the layout and a  white calibrated tape has been strung from that building  back to a miniature of the map room. Now Indy begins examining  the mosaic base line for the staff. Sunlight has moves further  down across the miniature. ndy's face reflects his concentration. And then his immense  pleasure. He sees what he came for. ndy is on his knees at the miniature city, a special tape  measure in his hand. Indy has the tape strung from Belloq's  mistaken spot to his own correct spot. He gets his reading,  leaps up and crosses to the erect staff. He pulls the  headpiece off the staff and hides it in his robes. He quickly  breaks the wooden staff in two and throws the pieces behind  a pile of debris. Then he moves quickly to beneath the  skylight. ndy sticks his head out the skylight, sees it clear and  flops his body out. Sallah, crouching behind the oil drum,  immediately starts pulling in the makeshift rope. Sallah  stuffs the rope in the oil drum and the two men begin waking  toward some tents. ndy bows in wild subservience and hurries off in the opposite  direction. ndy hustles between the tents. Up ahead, two German Officers  stop to talk, blocking his exit. He moves along the side of  one of the tents until he finds an opening and slips inside. ndy finds himself in a tent set up for rather comfortable  living. He has just started to cross it when he hears a loud,  excited grunting. He turns toward the sound. In the corner,  tied to a chair and gagged is Marion. Indy rushes to her,  snatches the gag from her mouth and embraces her. They kiss,  deep and long. ndy pulls out a knife and then stops suddenly, thinking. ndy pops the gag back in her mouth. Her eyes widen in fury  and she grunts obscenities at him. n the eerie conjunction of moonlight and torchlight, Indy  and the other men step back in awe of their discovery: there,  flush with the bottom of their pit, is a heavy stone entry  door to an underground chamber. Special prying tools are  produced. With two men assigned to each of the two long tools,  they work in unison to open the vault. They open it a foot  and the other men rush in to flop the heavy door completely  open. Down inside, only blackness. ndy drops his torch to the floor of the Well. This is  answered by the most horrific HISSING imaginable. ndy shakes his head and talks to himself. ndy lands on the floor of the Well. He looks at the altar  over a sea of undulating death. He picks up an oil canister  and splashes two parallel lines of oil and lights them. A  path six feet wide begins to open to the altar. Behind Indy,  Sallah comes quickly down the rope. ndy and Sallah are on the altar. Pushing together with all  their strength, the heavy stone top of the protective chest  begins to slide away. Indy and Sallah exchange slightly wary  but very excited looks, then continue to push. As the Ark  begins to be exposed, the air seems to almost vibrate, to  become electrostatically charged. We hear what sounds like a  low HUM. The sea of snakes around the altar draws back further  from this presence. ndy holds his torch out like a lantern and begins a slow O- turn, his eyes peering into the gloom, examining every inch  of wall and ceiling. ndy and Marion peek out into the light from the shadows of  an abandoned excavation. Before them is the improvised  airstrip serving the digs: a crude runway, a tent supply  depot, two fuel tank trucks. Down by the fuel trucks a German  Mechanic is looking skyward. Now Indy and Marion look there  too, drawn by the roaring sound of - n the distance, the Flying Wing lands and rolls toward the  men. Gobler spins and heads back toward the main camp, which  is hidden from view by a rise. Indy and Marion watch him go. ndy and Marion run in a crouch to a hiding spot closer to  the plane, near the supply tent. Suddenly, a Second German  Mechanic appears behind them. He is as surprised as they  are, but recovers quickly and swings a big monkey wrench at  Indy. Indy grabs the swinging arm and the two men tumble out  into the open, wrestling. Marion remains hidden, moving fast  among the crates. n the cockpit of the Flying Wing, the Pilot has been fiddling  with his gauges just prior to shutting off his engines. Now  he notices the fight going on outside. n the big space near the Command Tent is parked an open  German staff car; inside is a Blond Driver and an Armed Guard.  Directly behind it is a canvas-topped troop truck. At this  moment, Belloq and Shliemann are supervising the careful  placement of the crated Ark in the back of the truck. When  it is securely placed inside, we hear an ominous marching  sound and Nine Armed Nazis appear at a trot from between  some tents and climb into the back of the truck with the  Ark. ndy cuts cross-country avoiding the road the convoy has  taken. He leaps gullies, climbs dunes, slides down slopes.  Soon the convoy comes into view far below him. He tears along  a parallel ridge, like an Indian shadowing a wagon train. n the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver stop their  fight temporarily and cooperate in turning the steering wheel.  The truck barely stays on the road. n the cab of the truck, Indy and the Truck Driver again  stop trying to choke each other long enough to negotiate the  turn together. The bumper of the truck hits the broken guard  rail and sends it flying off the cliff. The truck, however,  holds the road. n the rear car, Gobler and Belzig are trying to see through  the thick clouds of dust. Suddenly is clears completely.  Unfortunately for them, this happens because their car has  shot out into space at the hairpin turn. They are flying to  their final reward. Belzig, eyes wide behind his evil  spectacles, screams as he goes. n the cab of the truck, the Truck Driver is distracted by  the sight of the flying staff car. Indy plasters him and he  tumbles out. n the back of the truck, a TOUGH SERGEANT takes command of  the situation. He picks out six Armed Nazis and motions for  them to start climbing around the outside of the truck to  the cab. With some trepidation the lucky ones begin that  maneuver. The truck is swerving like crazy. n the front staff car, the Armed Guard aims his submachine  guns back at Indy, alone now in the truck's cab. Shliemann  knocks the barrel roughly away. ndy sees this from the cab and reacts by speeding up, putting  even more pressure on the Blond Driver. n the cab, Indy has been concentrating on the lead staff  car. Now, just before entering the tunnel, he looks in the  side view mirror and sees the Nazis on his side. A quick  glance to the other mirror reveals the others. As the truck  sweeps into the tunnel, we see Indy just start to turn his  steering wheel - he is going to sideswipe the walls of the  tunnel n the rear of the truck, the Tough Sergeant is looking with  distaste back at the tunnel. There remains only him and two  Armed Nazis with the Ark. He sends these two climbing up  over the top of the truck. n the lead car, the Blond Driver is being pressed hard by  Indy, who now edges up to bump them from the rear. Suddenly  the Armed Guard next to the Driver sees the two Armed Nazis  appear on the top of the truck. Without thinking, he starts  to point them out to Shliemann, then realizes his stupidity. n the cab, Indy has seen this and is at first mystified. He  checks his sideview mirrors. Then he figures it out and slams  on his brakes. The brakes lock, the wheels burn and the truck  skids to a dusty halt. The two Armed Nazis fly off the truck,  over the cab to the road in front. Indy immediately hits the  gas again. The two Armed Nazis, just aiming their weapons,  get wiped out. n the rear of the truck, the crated Ark is bouncing all  alone, no one in sight, because - ndy, who has ducked at the gunfire, is confused. But when  he sees the Armed Guard up front lower his gun, Indy again  floors it and begins bumping the staff car in earnest. n the staff car, the occupants are bruised but safe.  Shliemann points at the departing truck and yells at the  Blond Driver. The staff car fishtails out of its sandy resting  place and takes off after the truck. ndy has an ever-decreasing lead on the staff car as the  race thunders into the narrow streets. People and animals  leap out of the way; carts and barrels go flying helter  skelter. Indy takes the truck down a street so narrow there  are only inches to spare on each side. Pedestrians jump into  doorways. ndy comes in, takes off his hat, jacket, whip and holster.  The door which connects this cabin to the next opens and  Marion appears. She is carrying a half-full glass of liquor,  but what you notice is the long, snow-white, high-necked  nightgown she is wearing. It is very prim. Very innocent.  And very sexy. Marion does a slightly embarrassed model's  turn for Indy. ndy sits on the cot, takes off his boots. He leans back  against the wall and rubs his eyes. Marion sits on the bed,  leans back against the wall with him and looks down at her  white nightgown. She chuckles. ndy runs toward the bow, then climbs some steps four at a  time. A MESSENGER PIRATE is hurrying to get him, but flies  by him on the steps. By the time the Pirate stops himself,  Indy is gone. ndy tears along the deck. He looks over the rail and sees  two Nazi rafts already next to the ship. ndy flies down some stairs and starts to round a corner.  Suddenly he throws himself backwards, out of view. Three  uniformed Nazis are clustered near a cabin door holding the  Messenger Pirate. Now two more come out of the cabin trying  to maintain their grasp on a kicking, yelling Marion. She is  still wearing her white nightgown. More Nazis clamber onto  the deck and head toward Indy, slamming open doors, rousting  Pirates, spouting racial epithets. Indy steps backwards and  fades into the maze of the ship. ndy pulls his dripping body onto the sub's main deck. He  has lost his felt hat once and for all. Other than that, his  outfit is the same as always, just wetter. Suddenly, water  is washing over his feet; the Wurrfler is beginning to  submerge. Indy runs through quickly deepening water toward  the haven of the conning tower. Halfway there, he slips and  goes down. Only by grabbing the base of the aftmast light  does he keep from being swept away. He struggles to his feet  and sloshes through knee-deep water to the base of the conning  tower. ndy climbs the ladder to the bridge of the conning tower  and looks down. The water is rising toward his fast. Indy  climbs the ladder to the top of the turret and braces himself  between the two uprights there - the 7 foot radio mast and  the 20 foot periscope. Still the ocean comes up to meet him.  Soon the top of the turret is under water and the radio mast  is disappearing. Indy shifts his grip to the periscope,  working his way up it and hanging on for dear life as the  ocean whips at his body. The periscope is quickly going under.  Indy hangs on to the top three feet, all that remains above. t's as terrible as Indy might have feared. He looks wasted.  Waterlogged and exhausted. The wet leather of the whip is  contracting and he must struggle constantly to keep it from  cutting into his skin. ndy looks through barely open eyes at the sharks running  alongside. There is nothing to be done. His eyes close. ndy rises desperately through the dark water, his hand  outstretched. Then, almost simultaneously, hand and head hit  solid rock. But no air. Indy feels along the ceiling of rock.  Nothing. It's all submerged. ndy dives, stroking deep into the tunnel. When he has  descended 15 feet, he grabs a vine and steadies himself. His  eyes search the dim roof of the tunnel. He sees his last  hope in the distance - a small blue circle, an air pocket.  He swims for it. n the air pocket, Indy's head breaks the surface and smashes  into rock again. The pocket is only six inches deep. No  matter. Indy loves it. He'd like to move in. He gulps air. ndy is making his way up the tunnel. He hears cars coming  from up ahead and steps into the shadows. A mine car passes  with several laughing Nazis. Indy continues on his way. ndy makes a fast break from the shadows of the tunnel to  the protection of a high stack of supplies. He climbs the  back of the stack, peeks over and surveys the area. n addition to the Tabernacle, the second train tunnel  entrance, and all the activity, Indy's glance rests  momentarily on a large, heavy metal door halfway down one  wall toward the Tabernacle. It bears the words, in German:  ""DANGER - MUNITIONS"" ndy continues to scan the scene. n the central area with the Ark, Shliemann and the other  Nazis wait impatiently, eyeing the Ark with some discomfort.  Belloq is not visible, because at the moment he is - n the folds of the Tabernacle, the silk of the tents  undulating around him. The light is even stranger, the scene  almost dreamlike. With the help of the Tall Captain, Belloq  lets an extraordinary, gold-embroidered, ceremonial robe  fall over his head and onto his body. Belloq looks  transported, possessed. The Tall Captain unlatches a wooden  case and takes from it a sturdy ivory rod about 5 feet long,  elaborately engraved. Belloq takes it from him, turns and  slips back through the silk. The Tall Captain stays in the  folds. ndy steps into the Tabernacle. On his shoulder is a bazooka  and it is aimed directly at the Ark. nside the Ark of the Covenant is a preview of the end of  the world. A light so bright, a power so fearsome, a charge  so jolting, that there is nothing in our world to compare to  it. It's as though this magnificent golden box has been  gathering electric energy for three thousand years, waiting  for just this crack of the lid to release it all in one fast,  cleansing explosion of pure force. ndy grabs a rifle with bayonet from the prostrate body of  one of his former escorts and runs back into the flaming  Tabernacle. ndy jumps through the flames into what is now a tent of  fire. He looks around at the dead bodies, then at the Ark.  The lid has slammed down shut again and the Ark shines gold  in the flames. Before it, where Belloq once stood, is a pile  of ash and charred debris. Indy registers this, then continues  to scan the scene. ndy rushes toward her, unaware of a uniformed Nazi who has  appeared from the flames. Marion looks up to see Indy and  the Nazi leveling his submachine gun at Indy. She motions  desperately with her eyes. Indy dives and rolls through the  flames just as the Nazi opens fire. From the floor, Indy  blasts the Nazi. ndy jumps up and runs toward the bound Marion, his bayonet  aimed directly at her. Her wide eyes flash between the flames  and the shining blade. Expertly, Indy slashes down both sides  at Marion, cutting all four bindings. Marion falls backwards,  away from the flames, but before she hits the ground, Indy  is there, catching her in his arms. ndy rises, pulling her up with him. The Tabernacle is burning  away so fast that soon Indy and Marion will be completely  exposed. Indy rushes over and grabs the submachine gun and a  Luger from the dead Nazi. ndy stops, startled by her spunky attitude. He's considering  their changes. ndy and Marion make their way along the side of the center  court, Indy grimacing with the strain of pulling the Ark.  One Nazi stops directly in front of them, looking at them  queerly. Indy knocks him out with the butt of his Luger just  as Marion is about to fire. ndy kicks the throttle one more time and it goes! Their car  doubles its speed and shoots under the low cross beam at the  same instant as - ndy and Marion look back at the low cross beam as the last  tongue of flame makes it there and then is doused by falling  rock and dirt. They look at each other, then turn their  attention back to their own predicament. Their mine car is  going incredible fast as it moves into a downward section of  wildly twisting tunnel. ndy is already pulling the throttle. It moves easily.  Unfortunately, it is no longer attached to the motor. The  mine car is out of control. After several moments, far ahead,  appears a circle of bright daylight - the end of the tunnel!  It approaches at a frightening rate. Indy reaches out and  grasps Marion's hand. They exchange looks and then turn to  look ahead. n the out-of-control mine car, Indy pulls Marion down with  him. They are squashed into the corner trying to avoid contact  with the bouncing Ark. Bullets clang against the outside of  the car and whiz inches overhead. Indy and Marion are forced  into a tighter and tighter embrace of life. ndy, Brody, and Marion, looking very stylish, are seated in  Colonel Musgrove's huge office. Sun pours in a window, through  which Washington can be seen sparkling across the Potomac.  Everything is neat and clean and regular. Including the three  men who are arrayed around the office. Two we know - Col.  Musgrove and Maj. Eaton. The third is an unnamed Bureaucrat.  He hangs back, smiling and genial, his features obscured by  the glare of the window. He doesn't say anything, yet you  have a sense that the others defer to him in the matter at  hand. He is the essence of all that is Byzantine and  inscrutable in our scrubbed government machine. ndy and Brody are dissatisfied with the way the meeting has  gone. Marion, on the other hand, is very happy and eager to  get out of there. Eaton's manner is irritatingly cheery. ndy exchanges a look with Brody. ndy looks them over coldly. He gets up, sullen. ndy, Brody and Marion emerge from the building. Brody bids  them farewell and moves off in another direction. Marion  clings to Indy's arm in an energetic, very feminine way,  scolding him. ndy stops, looking across the river, his mind occupied."
1,indiana_jones_raiders,T,"he dense, lush rain forests of the eastern slopes of the  Andes, the place known as ""The Eyebrow of the Jungle"". Ragged,  jutting canyon walls are half-hidden by the thick mists. he MAIN TITLE is followed by this: he entire party is struck by the sight. The Indians,  terrified now, chatter away. Suddenly the three at the back  turn and run, dropping their packs as they go. Barranca yells  at the fleeing Indians and pulls his pistol out. He starts  to raise his arm to aim but Indy restrains it in a muscular  grip. he party fans out to fight their way through the entwined  trees that guard the temple. Visibility is cut to five feet  in the heavy mist. Satipo extracts a short, native dart from  a tree and examines the point gingerly he two Indiana jabber in Quechua, near hysteria. Barranca  is sweating profusely, eyes darting. He yells at the Indians  in Quechua to ""shut up"". he fall of the whip (the unplaited strip at the end of the  lash) wraps itself around Barranca's hand and pistol. He  could not drop the gun now if he tried. he men reach an arch in the hall. The small chamber ahead,  which interrupts the hall, is brightly lit by a shaft of  sunlight from high above. Indy stops, looks it over. he men are in a high, straight hallway 50 feet long. he door at the end is flooded with sunlight. hey begin walking down the hall side by side. Satipo has  inched a little ahead. Suddenly his lead foot comes down and  through the floor! As Satipo begins to pitch forward, Indy  grabs him by the belt and pulls him back. They both look  down at the ""floor"". wo torches, many years old, are in holders by the door.  Indy takes one down and lights it. He gives the regular torch  to Satipo. orch in hand, Indy begins his careful walk across the  sanctuary. Stepping only on the white tiles, he almost appears  to be doing a martial arts kata. Before each big move he  waves the torch in front of him head to toe, looking at the  flame. Halfway out, he sees something on the floor and kneels  to look at it. he sanctuary has begun to rumble and shake in response to  the mysterious mechanism. Just as Indy goes out the door, a  rock shakes loose from the wall and rolls onto the tiles  floor. Immediately, a noisy torrent of poison darts fills  the room. he Curator of the National Museum in Washington, D.C. Brody  is examining the small artifacts Indy pocketed on his way  into the Peruvian Temple. He occasionally uses a jeweler's  eyepiece to get a closer look. But he is distracted, his  concerns elsewhere, and it is this that his old friend Indy  senses from across the room. he Teaching Assistant leaves. Brody is scowling as he  examines the last of the artifacts. he lush tone continues here in Art Deco and shiny marble.  Indy motions Brody toward the study to one side. he three Germans wait impatiently in a magnificent foyer. A  chime sounds and huge double doors open to reveal TENGTU  HOK, flanked by two uniformed Japanese Soldiers and a robed  Chinese Advisor. He wears a fantastic gold ornamental robe.  Despite the majesty, however, nothing can disguise the fact  that Hok is basically a wild, fat barbarian; an animal. Hok  and his escort group bow in what is the beginning of a long  welcoming ceremony. The Germans exchange impatient glances  but decide they should play it as it comes. They bow. he three Germans are being served tea and exotic delicacies.  A pleased Tengtu Hok watches from a throne-cushion. When the  tray of tiny delicacies is presented to him, he takes a  massive handful, crushing them together on their way to his  smiling mouth. engtu Hok and the Germans have obviously heard something.  They are hurrying along the walkway at the side of the  building, Hok in the lead. Up ahead is the foot bridge which  crosses from the palace to the museum entrance over a moat. he Lovely Mercedes limousine blows up. he Germans spin toward the blast. Drawing weapons, they run  back to investigate. Hok follows them, confused. he double doors at the entrance slam open to reveal Hok.  Indy is halfway along an unprotected wall back to his  ventilation entry route. Hok opens up on him, cutting off  his retreat. Indy jumps behind a marble column, which is  promptly blasted with machine gun fire. he plane flies west into the sunset. he bar has quieted ominously and so we hear with startling  clarity when - a door behind the bar slams open with a huge  BANG! and some Presence, too small to be seen as it moves  through the forest of towering patrons, makes a beeline for  the troubled corner of the bar. A path clears for it. he Sherpa and the Climber are about to kill each other when  the Presence arrives directly between them: she is MARION  RAVENWOOD, twenty-five years old, beautiful, if a bit hard- looking. At this moment, however, that look does not hurt.  She is not intimidated by the combatants; she jabs accusatory  fingers into their chests. She is angry as hell. The patrons  shrink under her gaze. he place clears quickly. Stragglers and grumblers are given  special attention by Marion and Mahdlo, who has come from  behind the bar carrying a big axe handle. Mahdlo herds the  crows out the front door as Marion turns and walks behind  the bar. his stops her. he Four Bad Men who advance on her are: he Mongolian and the Nepalese poke around, checking to make  sure there's no one else there. he Second Nazi lights up at this suggestion. Belzig gives  him a withering look. he glowing poker point moves inexorably across the room  toward Marion's face. he tip of the poker is five inches from Marion's nose when  there is a loud CRACK! and the fall of Indy's bullwhip wraps  around the middle of the poker and tears it out of Belzig's  hands. The poker sails high across the room, free of the  whip, and lands in the heavy curtains that cover one window.  The curtains immediately burst into flame. he four Bad Men look in surprise toward the front entrance.  Indy is poised there, the whip in his right hand, a .45  automatic raised toward them in his left. he Mongolian had just come around the bar at the end opposite  the medallion. He dives back to crouch behind the end of the  bar, raising his submachine gun. he Mongolian, who sticks his submachine gun out and fires  blindly in Indy's direction. he Mongolian, seeing this, stands up confidently. Marion  rises behind him and bashes him over the head with the axe  handle. He goes down and out. hat done, Indy brings a brass spittoon down on the Giant  Sherpa's wrist and the .45 slides away. Indy jumps up and  kicks the Giant Sherpa, who barely seems to feel it. He grabs  Indy and flips him effortlessly onto a table. he Mongolian points his Mauser through the smoke and flame  at Indy. Suddenly, the Mongolian is shot dead. he gaggle of grinning off-spring parts to reveal in their  midst - a MONKEY. It is munching some flat Arab bread. he wind dies down. Indy shakes off a chill and stares  thoughtfully at his friend. he Monkey is seen running around another corner and jumps  into the waiting arms of MONKEY MAN, who appears to be like  a beggar with a dirty turban and an eye patch. Monkey Man  immediately hurries down the street and passes into a  building. In the building are two GERMAN AGENTS. Monkey Man  and the Monkey both give the Heil Hitler salute and engage  in quick talk. he only witness: The Monkey, who is now perched on the fire  foot wall. he chattering Monkey leads a German Agent and two Bad Arabs  to Marion's hiding place, gesturing maniacally. he German Agent leads the way as the two Bad Arabs carry  the huge basket above their heads. The basket top has been  fastened closed, but Marion is making a fuss inside. At the  place where the street cuts across the far side of the bazaar,  Marion is able to wedge the top open one inch and screams - he Bad Guys move the basket as fast as they can through  streets, alleys and passageways thick with people. Indy always  seems to round a corner just in time to catch a glimpse of  the basket before it disappears around a new corner. Indy  must fight a flow of humanity as powerful as an ocean riptide.  Finally, at the head of one particularly crowded alley, Indy  leaps up onto a wall for a clearer view. Whatever he sees  gives him an idea and he cuts between two buildings rather  than following the basket. wo Bad Arabs come running down the Alley with the basket  between them. Suddenly, Indy's whip flashes out sending both  Arabs and the basket tumbling. Indy steps into view, his .45  trained on the sprawled Arabs, and looks at the basket. The  top has come flying off and the contents have clattered onto  the cobblestone: inside is not Marion, but a load of  contraband pistols, rifles and ammo. Indy is advancing on  the trembling Bad Arabs with an ugly look when suddenly he  hears Marion scream around the corner. he German Agent has stopped firing in order to drive. He  floors it, aiming for a street at the corner of the square.  Indy uses the lull to take careful aim at the German Agent's  profile and fire off three careful shots. The German Agent  is hit, blasted dead against the steering wheel. The speeding  truck swerves, hits a wall, rolls over and explodes in an  enormous, multi-leveled eruption as its contents ignite.  Several surrounding buildings are leveled. he Arab Bartender does a take, looking at the three, tough  GERMAN HENCHMEN who have surrounded Indy from out of the  smoke, their hands stuffed in bulging trenchcoat pockets.  Indy notices them now with a bleary glance. He decides he's  in no shape to kill or be killed and moves with them across  the room, taking his bottle with him. The Arab patrons take  this in and mind their own business. he occupant of the smoke-shrouded corner table becomes  visible only as Indy reaches there: it is Emile Belloq. He  is drinking wine. here's a certain amount of truth to this; the recognition  of it flickers across Indy's bleary eyes. Belloq sees it  there. he front door of the bar slams open and all nine of SALLAH'S  CHILDREN scamper in and over to a surprised Indy. Two of the  smallest hop into his lap. he children usher Indy out. he two men go and huddle over the old man. The Monkey peeks  up over the edge of the table at the array of food. He picks  up a date and disappears below the table. Amir points to  some markings on the lower part of the headpiece. he Monkey's paw comes up over the edge of the table and  grabs another date. wo old trucks come down a narrow mountain road and onto the  flat surface of the desert. he Tanis Digs are laid out below like a painting. Trucks,  bulldozers, Arab workers and German supervisors are  everywhere. The excavations themselves are extensive and  somewhat random-holes have been dug and then abandoned,  foundations and passageways unearthed and then deserted.  Beyond the main digs, a crude airstrip has been created.  Sallah points to what appears to be a mound of dirt with a  hole in it near the center of the activity. he Jeep German starts back toward his major concern: his  jeep is stuck in some sand beyond the next tent. Some Arab  Workers are trying in vain to budge it. Now another German  has backed his truck up to it. Sallah can think of nothing  to do expect obey. With a worried glance at the map room, be  begins untying the rope from the oil drum. he moment has arrived. Even the tension of the circumstances  cannot distract Indy from the purity of what he is about to  do. All his calculations are adjustments complete, Indy takes  the Staff of Ra and places it - CLINK! - in the right  depression on the base line. This is as active and exciting  a moment as any archeologist can dream of and, at heart,  that is exactly what Indy is. The sunlight catches the very  top of the headpiece and moves within a fraction of an inch  of the tiny hole in its sun. he edge of the sunlight moving across the miniature city is  still a good two feet beyond the spot Belloq has settled on.  And now that line of light is broken by the shadow of an  ornate sun at the top of the staff. his new spot gives Indy a higher, better view of the whole  scene. Indy is using a surveyor's instrument to take a reading - hey continue to dig furiously, all of them drenched in sweat.  The hole has grown but this is slow, back-breaking work. he men quickly prostrate themselves around the edge of the  entry to look inside. Indy and Sallah each take a torch and  hold them down the hole. he Well of the Souls is a spooky chamber thirty feet deep.  The walls are covered with hieroglyphics and carvings. The  roof is supported intermittently by stone pillars, the closest  of which hits the roof very near the entry hole. The Well is  quite large; as Indy and Sallah wave their torches, more and  more of the room is revealed. Now the far end of the chamber  comes into view. There is a stone altar down there and on  this elaborated carved platform is a stone chest, big enough  to enclose the Lost Ark and protect it from the ravages of  time. This altar appears to be the only place on the floor  of the Well that is not covered by a strange, dark carpet of  some kind. hat think dark carpet is moving. It's alive. It's thousands  and thousands of deadly poisonous snakes - Egyptian asps.  And the only thing that seems capable of avoiding this  venomous groundcover is the altar. The snakes ebb and flow  near it, but never encroach on it, as though repelled by  some invisible force. he sky is just beginning to lighten over the dunes to the  east, making dangerously obvious the thin column of smoke  rising from the entrance to the Well. Omar and his men are  peering through the smoke down into the Well. he wooden crate stands open next to the stone chest. Now  Indy extracts the wooden poles from its rings and begins  fitting them through the rings in the Ark. This takes some  maneuvering by the two men, but soon they are able to lift  the Ark clear of the stone chest and into the wooden crate.  They extract the poles, fasten the top of the crate and stick  the poles through the rings of the wooden crate. They start  back toward the space under the hole. he fire strips have begun to dwindle, as have some of the  torches. The snakes move slowly in toward the clear spaces.  Indy and Sallah eye them nervously as they hurry along with  their heavy load. Under the hole, they hurriedly attach ropes  to the wooden crate and it is pulled up. Indy's concentration  is on the tide of snakes. oo late. Indy runs back through the path of flames to the  center of the room. Snakes strike as his flying heels. Indy  reaches the base of the pillar which he touched briefly on  his original descent. He uses his torch to clear away the  scattered snakes climbing on it, then pulls out his whip. He  draws it back, then wraps is solidly around the pillar 15  feet up. With the torch in his mouth, he begins climbing the  pillar. It moves ominously under his weight. he last two torches still burning on the floor go out. Now  the only light in the chamber is provided by the torches  held by Indy and Marion and the dwindling oil flames. Snakes  move in and surround the base of Indy's pillar. The path  between Marion and the center of the room is overrun. The  circle of flame around Marion is dying down. She looks beyond  it with terror-widened eyes, then up through the increasing  smoke at the distant Indy. he pillar goes! In the dim light, we see it fall like a  tree directly at Marion. Indy rides it down. The top hits  the wall three feet from a cringing Marion and smashes through  to a black chamber beyond. Indy flies off into the darkness.  Gone. Marion clutches her torch at the black hole. here is a moment that seems an eternity, then Indy appears  like an apparition out of the void. he winding string of connected chambers is revealed to them  only a few feet at a time as their torch lights the way. hey round a corner and flush a covey of bats. Marion screams. here, coming through the crack in the corner of the next  chamber, is white blessed sunlight. he Flying Wing rolls up into the space near the fuel trucks.  The German Mechanic puts blue blocks in front of the tires  as the engines continue to roar. he first German Mechanic, who is just pulling the fuel hose  from the tank truck to the plane, sees the combatants and  runs to help his countryman. He is almost upon them when  Indy puts the Second German away with a devastating left -  right - left combination. He turns to find the first German  Mechanic flying at him. The roll toward the rear of the Flying  Wing and its lethally spinning reversed propellers. he fistfight between Indy and the German Mechanic has taken  on a new stomach-tightening dimension. The men are fighting  and flailing in and out between the spinning props at the  back of the plane's wings. Each man comes within inches of  becoming instant mincemeat. he Pilot slides away the top of his cockpit and stands up.  He pulls a Luger from his side and points it, waiting for a  clear shot at Indy. The German Mechanic kicks Indy away from  him and the Pilot aims his pistol. Suddenly, Marion appears  behind the Pilot, standing on the opposite wing, and bashes  him over the head with one of the blue blocks that was holding  the tires. The Pilot drops down into the cockpit, his body  falling on the throttle. The engines roar louder, revving  up. The plane begins to roll, rotating around its one still- blocked set of tires. Marion grabs onto the cockpit to keep  from slipping into the props. She bends into the cockpit,  trying to pull the Pilot's body off the throttle. No luck.  She grimaces and climbs inside. Her shoulder bumps the top  of the cockpit; it slides tightly shut above her. he other prop of the Flying Wing slice into a tank truck.  The airplane fuel inside floods out onto the pavement,  surrounding the plane. Indy backpedals away from the plane,  his eyes searching the scene for Marion. Suddenly, he is  shocked to see her in the cockpit. He runs toward her,  skidding through the gasoline. hree Armed Nazis stand guard around the wooden crate  containing the Ark. It is sitting near the flopped-open  entrance to the Command Tent and there is furious activity  going on here. Belloq, Shliemann, Gobler, Belzig and assorted  Aides are packing up all the papers and personal items in  preparation for a hasty departure. he scene by the truck: Belloq and Shliemann are about to  climb into the front staff car when they pause to check out  the final component of the convoy. Rolling into place behind  the truck is another open staff car. But this one is special -  mounted in the back is a big, black machine gun, manned by a  Gunner. At the wheel of the car is Gobler and next to him  sits Belzig. he convoy is entering rougher country. The narrow mountain  road we've seen earlier ascends ahead. To the side of the  road are tall boulders. Suddenly, Indy shoots out from between  two rocks and rides directly for the truck. The Armed Nazis  in the back of the truck can see nothing because the canvas  hides their view. But Gobler, Belzig and the Gunner in the  rear staff car have a brief line on him. Belzig points and  the Gunner fires away and Indy, the bullets kicking up sand  near Indy's horse. he Armed Guard in the cab of the truck leans out to see  what's happening. Indy has been riding alongside. Now he  stands on the horse and leaps to the cab. In a second, he  has flipped the Armed Guard out of the truck. He slides into  the cab and begins grappling with the Truck Driver. The Truck  Driver tries to hit the brakes, but Indy kicks his foot away  and floors the gas pedal. The truck doubles its speed and  shoots onto the steep mountain road. he Blond Driver of the front staff car sees the truck move  up on him in the rearview mirror and speeds up. Belloq,  Shliemann and the Armed Guard in the car twist around to  look at the struggle in the truck. The Blond Driver begins  what will be a continuing preview of the twists in the road.  He turns his wheel sharply and takes the lead car around a  bend. he lead staff car reaches the summit of the road and barely  makes the hairpin turn there, delivering a destructive blow  to the guard rail that has been placed there. The guard rail  is now bent. he Tough Sergeant is on the top of the truck, making his  way steadily forward. This guy clearly knows what he's doing.  A submachine gun is slung across his back. he truck and the staff car race through a series of S-curves.  In the staff car, Belloq and Shliemann spot the Tough Sergeant  as he reaches the front of the truck's top and begins to  lower his submachine gun barrel toward the cab. Indy is  unaware. Belloq and Shliemann exchange looks. Then Shliemann  yells to the Armed Guard in the front seat. he Tough Sergeant has a line on Indy. He points his gun.  The Armed Guard blasts away at the truck. The Tough Sergeant  dies in a hail of bullets and flies off. he road is almost down to a level now. In the distance -  Cairo. The road takes a little dogleg just before reaching  level ground again. Just as the staff car is about to make  the turn, Indy smashes them from behind. The staff car flies  off the road and down a twenty foot embankment. Indy takes  the truck speeding down the road and off toward Cairo. he waterfront is dark and misty. An old tramp steamer, the  BANTU WIND, sits by the pier. Several fierce Black African  Pirates, the crewmembers, are taking on final stores. he Bantu Wind is bathed in moonlight as it cuts across even  seas. he ship's rats are agitated. They tremble and chatter at  the edges of the compartment, darting about. Out in the center  of the hold, sitting all by itself, is the crated Ark. HUM-M- M-M. he ship is swarming with Nazis. The Black Pirates are herded  forward, subjected to rough physical and verbal abuse by the  Aryan Supermen. The Pirates are clearly under orders not to  resist, but not one of these strong men likes it. They'd  gladly give their lives to rip the throat out of a few Krauts.  In the hold, the door slams open and Nazis pour in; they  smile at the sight of the crated Ark. he Ark is taken away. his appeals to Shliemann's nature. He signals his agreement  with a gesture. Belloq ushers Marion away with her two  keepers. he Nazis have returned to their subs. Shliemann is on the  bridge with the WURRFLER'S CAPTAIN and the Captain's Aides.  The Captain is an honorable career Navy man. he Wurrfler's Captain smiles, salutes crisply, then goes  below, pulling the hatch closed. Immediately, the Wurrfler  begins to move. And as it does, we see the rail at the aft  of the main deck. From nowhere, a wet sleeve appears and a  hand grabs the rail! he forward movement of the sub continues, but, to Indy's  slowly dawning delight, the dive stops. No more of the  periscope goes under. Indy smiles; it's a pretty good smile,  too, given the circumstances. Indy pulls out his bullwhip  and begins tying himself to the periscope. he sun warms that part of his body Indy has contrived to  keep out of the water. The rest floats out behind. Indy isn't  comfortable, but all in all, it's not as terrible as he might  have feared. he submarine has stopped. The water is calm. The moon is  bright. A gentle swell splashes Indy awake. He blinks, tries  to regain his senses. He makes an inventory of his body.  Surprised to find himself intact, his spirits lift. Some  hidden reserve of energy flows through him. He frees his  aching arms from the wet leather of his whip, leaving only  one loop around his waist to hold him to the sub. He rubs  his hands and stretches. Once again, he has survived. To  fight again. He looks around. he sub enters an underwater tunnel that penetrates into the  cliffs. Indy is held to the periscope by his crossed legs  and the whip. His impromptu air bubble is working, but it's  a struggle to maintain it. he sub begins to cut through think marine vegetation. Each  dangling growth pulls at Indy's body and slaps at his leather  bubble. Now a clump of entwined seaweed rips the leather out  of his hands and his bubble of air rises away. Indy hangs  on, holding his breath, but the vegetation gets denser.  Finally, it pulls him off the periscope. The sub moves on,  disappearing ahead. he Wurrfler has arrived at an extraordinary base built in  the hollow interior of the island. This chamber, with the  docking bay, is almost all water. A huge natural cavern, it  has been reinforced and enlarged by the Germans. he Wurrfler sits surfaced at the dock. The Ark has been  unloaded and placed on a cart. Shliemann, Belloq and Marion  have just disembarked and been met by a Nazi contingent from  the base. Marion looks worse for the trip. Her white nightgown  is now ripped and smudged. he Ark and its entourage are moving slowly up the tight  dark tunnel, their way lit by intermittent lanterns. The  tunnel is irregular, but generally about 7 feet wide. It's  height varies from an average of about 7 feet to a low of  only about 4.5 feet at the points (every 40 feet) where  support beams cross the track. The result is that there is  only about a foot of clearance above the mine cars at those  points; passengers must duck to keep from being hit in the  head. Shliemann, looking worried, and Belloq, very excited,  are focused on the Ark in the car ahead. he light in here is lovely, unearthly. Oil lamps burn. The  Tabernacle is really several concentric, silk tents, which  creates a flowing maze effect. The innermost tent has at its  center a 3-foot high, tapestry-covered altar. Belloq watches  with gleaming, obsessed eyes as two Nazis carefully lift the  actual Ark out of its crate by means of the long poles. The  Ark dazzles the eye, seeming to glow gold in this strange  light. The two Nazis place it carefully on the altar.  Shliemann and some Aides hang back. Marion is nowhere to be  seen. he Tall Captain flies out of the silk and takes Indy down  by the neck. The bazooka clatters across the cement floor as  two other Nazis help subdue Indy. The three Nazis take Indy's  pistol from his holster and raise him roughly in their grasp. he far side of the Tabernacle burns completely away,  revealing Marion, tied spread-eagle between two upright posts.  Her nightgown is now in tatters, black with soot. She is  gagged, but her eyes are screaming, focused on the flaming  river of black oil which is about to engulf her feet. he river of burning oil is only a foot from Marion. hey embrace. They kiss. They break. hey approach the altar through the dying flames, Indy  slinging the submachine gun over his back. The long carrying  poles are still in place. wo huge stacks of goods are ablaze and the Nazis are having  trouble getting water to them. The Nazis main concern at  this point is an enormous, neat stack of wooden cartridge  boxes which are piled down the wall from one of the already  blazing, and now teetering, stacks of general goods. Nervous  Nazis are moving the heavy cartridge boxes as fast as they  can, but it's slow work and the threatening fire is close. he Officers are directing the placement of every moveable  item in front of the oil drums. Desks, crates, chairs, food,  all are heaped in front of the fuel. All the workers cast  frequent nervous glances back at the burning cartridge boxes  across the court. Suddenly the worst begins to happen at the  cartridge boxes. Hundreds of thousands of live cartridges  begin exploding, flying around the court like shrapnel. Hot  lead begins to zing off the exposed fuel drums, leaving big  dents. he car with Indy and Marion looks almost sluggish compared  to the pursuing Nazi car as they both make their way into an  usually long straightaway. Marion discards her empty  submachine gun as Indy kicks at his throttle and casts a  worried look back at Shliemann. he mine car smashes into the seed bag bunker. And right on  through. The Nazi Sentry, his machine gun and a dozen bursting  seed bags are slammed into the ocean in a wild, hurtling  mass. The mine car jumps, bounces and spins around, then  slides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the water. he first explosion happens. It's a baby compared to what's  coming yet it rocks the earth. It's terrible. And then, almost  immediately, another. The long, irregular, ever larger chain  of explosions begins. he island rumbles and shakes. From fissures and small natural  caves, dirt and rock shoot out like spraying water. Still  the explosion continue. A huge chunk of white cliff falls  away into the turbulent sea. Birds scream and soar, afraid  to land. hey move down the steps, smiling. he Ark of the Covenant sits in a wooden crate. A wooden lid  comes down and hides it from view. The lid is solidly nailed  to the crate as we read the stenciled message on top - he hammering is completed and hands shift the heavy crate  onto a dolly."
2,indiana_jones_raiders,A,"narrow trail across the green face of the canyon. A group  of men make their way along it. At the head of the party is  an American, INDIANA JONES. He wears a short leather jacket,  a flapped holster, and a brimmed felt hat with a weird feather  stuck in the band. Behind him come two Spanish Peruvians,  SATIPO and BARRANCA. Bringing up the rear are five Yagua  INDIANS. They act as porters and are wrangling the two heavily- packed llamas. The Indians become increasingly nervous. They  speak to each other in bursts of Quechua. The American, who  is known to his friends as Indy, glances back at them. large, domed room. Ten evenly-spaced skylights send their  shafts of sunlight down to a unique tiled floor: white and  black tiles laid out in a lovely, intricate pattern. Indy  and Satipo stand at the door and look across the wide room  at the altar. There, in the supreme hallowed spot, is a tiny  jeweled figurine, Indy's real objective. dead bird lies on one of the white tiles. Its body is  riddled with little deadly darts. This has great significance  to Indy and he stands with even greater caution. He waves  the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current  whips at the flame. Indy ducks under it and leaves a burn  mark on the white tile beneath it. n amphibian plane sits in the water beneath a green cliff.  Sitting on the wing is JOCK, the British pilot. Indy breaks  out of some distant brush and runs along the path at the top  of the cliff. young male graduate student, Indy's TEACHING ASSISTANT,  taps on the door and then pushes his way in with an armload  of reference books. Indy helps him find a spot for them. gain the military men have a silent communication, deciding  what to reveal. s Brody passes the entrance to the expansive living room,  he spots a beautiful, silk-gowned Harlow-type lounging on  the sofa in front of a roaring fire. She is sipping champagne. huge golden gong, seven feet in diameter, is suspended  from the ceiling by a hook. An enormous hammer hangs poised  above it, from which emanate myriad tiny threads which run  up and across the ceiling, then down to the various display  cases. Indy looks up at the gong, then continues his quick,  quiet foray among the cases. Beyond him, a high window. fierce Japanese Samurai is running at Indy full speed down  an aisle of display cases. His sword is raised over his  shoulder ready to cut Indy in half. He's six feet away when  Indy's gun levels and fires twice, blasting him backwards.  Indy is still looking over his gun when another samurai sword  comes down from the side and knocks the pistol brutally out  of Indy's grip; his hand avoids amputation by a quarter of  an inch. n amazed Indy backs away from the crossing aisle as the  Second Samurai steps in to face him, sword raised. Indy backs  away into an open space and his bullwhip appears in his hand.  He gives it one savage CRACK! to announce its arrival and  the Samurai slows down, eyeing it curiously. The Samurai  does not look unhappy about this confrontation. How pure it  is - The Sword versus The Whip. t the sound of the gong, the running Hok skids to a halt  with a crazed expression on his face. He disappears for two  seconds in an alcove and emerges holding a big, black Thompson  Submachine Gun. He runs across the foot bridge and is just  barely over it when it blows up. Hok, safe, looks behind him  in amazement and then turns to the museum. few rows back, across the aisle, a trenchcoated European  Spy eyes Indy. huge stuffed raven, wings spread wide, is mounted behind  the long bar in the noisy, crowded saloon. A lively mix of  patrons is represented in the late hour tableau: Nepalese  natives, fierce Sherpa mountain guides, sleazy international  smugglers and fugitives, and, of course, mountain climbers  from every corner of the earth. A tall Nepalese, MAHDLO, is  the bartender. scowl on her lovely face, she has just begun clearing the  bar of glasses when she notices one remaining Patron huddled  over a glass at the far end of the bar. Grimacing in  exasperation, she heads that way like a locomotive. huge smile lights up Marion's face. cross the street, the shadow in a doorway comes to life. A  dark form steps out to look at Indy's departing car; it is  the European Spy from the DC-3. He hurries off in the opposite  direction. n exhausted Indy uses his whole body to upend the Giant  Sherpa, who lands hard on his back. They are surrounded by  flames. t the end of the bar, the Mongolian has come back to life.  He shakes out his head, then reaches inside his coat and  pulls out a Mauser pistol. ll the children chatter their innocence at once. The Monkey  chatters too; it's an entertainer. The Monkey jumps from the  children's table to the adults' and struts slowly up toward  Marion, who thinks it's the cutest thing she ever saw. When  it reaches her, it takes off its turban and does a deep,  grand bow to her. She is delighted and takes the Monkey into  her arms. The Monkey kisses her cheek. The children laugh. s Indy and Marion turn a corner, the Monkey seems to notice  something and immediately jumps from Marion's shoulder and  hurries off at a frantic pace down the street. dark, smoke-filled den on iniquity. The patrons, almost  all fearsome Arabs, sit in small shadowy groups around the  room. Indy stands at the bar finishing off a fifth of bourbon.  He is drunk. The ARAB BARTENDER places a new bottle of  expensive bourbon in front of him. Indy eyes is queerly. mir's finger moves across the break as the markings continue  on the sun medallion. n extremely nervous Sallah has the gathered rope in his  hands and is trying to appear casual as he inches back toward  the oil drum. There is now a good bit of activity going on  up here. long pause. Then something comes down. A makeshift rope.  Really just a bunch of clothing tied together - tunics, robes,  pants. But what we see first and most prominently, the first  section of Indy's escape rope, is a bright Nazi flag. Indy  beams and climbs. fter a moment of this, he stops. He gathers his energy and  resolve and gets back to the task. s the top of the stone chest is pushed completely off and  slams down beside it, we see THE LOST ARK OF THE COVENANT.  It is awesomely beautiful, breathtaking. 4 feet long, 2.5  feet wide and 2.5 feet high. It's height, however, is  increased by the two sculptured gold angels mounted facing  each other on the top. Though the body of the Ark is acacia  wood, it has been overlaid with gold. An elaborate gold crown  surrounds the top edge and gold carrying rings are attached  to each corner. s Belloq speaks, Shliemann exchanges a look with Belzig.  Belzig smiles and takes the gag from Marion's mouth. huge WHOOSH! as air is sucked out and the chamber is sealed.  Half of the torches still burning go out with the sound. The  remaining torches continue to extinguish at punctuating  intervals throughout the following action and the snakes  immediately flood into the newly-darkened spaces. Indy puts  Marion down and snatches up two burning torches. He hands  one to Marion. large crowd of Arab Diggers is milling about among the  tents. They all want to get a look at the Ark. Sallah is  among them. All at once, there is a earthshaking explosion.  Al eyes turn toward the rise that hides the airstrip. A huge  fireball floats into view over there. Everyone starts running  toward it. Shliemann yells at Belzig and the Armed Nazis. lmost all the Arabs and Germans in the digs have congregated  here and are staring at the burning remains of the Flying  Wing. Belloq and Shliemann arrive just as the second fuel  truck blows up. The concussion knocks many of the observers  flat. Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler watch the scene in alarm. full view reveals the incredible geography of this ride.  The convoy in tiny against the spectacular mountainside, the  cliffs drop hundreds of feet. t the wheel of the rear car, Gobler swerves to stay on the  road and accidentally sideswipes a boulder. The Gunner perched  in the back is flipped head over heels out of the car. Gobler  and Belzig are having trouble seeing the road through all  the dust the convoy is kicking up. long the back of the truck, Armed Nazis are edging up toward  the cab, three on each side. They hang on as the truck rounds  a corner and goes into a straightaway that leads through a  short tunnel. t the other end of the tunnel, we hear the roar of the two  engine and two long, screeching, scraping sounds. The lead  staff car shoots out of the tunnel, then the truck, its sides  cleaned of Nazis. small light illuminates the top of the gangplank. In its  circle, Indy and Marion exchange long, warm embraces with  Sallah. A short distance away the ship's Captain, a handsome,  powerful black named SIMON KATANGA, watches from the rail,  smoking a pipe. lovely island. No sign of man's presence. The sub has  stopped at the mouth of a wide cove completely ringed by  tall white rock cliffs. Suddenly the sub begins to move again.  It is headed directly toward the center of the cliffs. Indy  holds on, mystified, alert. When the cliffs are very close,  the sub begins to dive. second natural cavern, even bigger than the first, has  been worked over by the Germans into a rectangular, three- story high supply center around a huge, open, center court.  Uniformed Nazi Soldiers are everywhere, wrangling supplies  and ammunition, monitoring electronic equipment. At the far  end of the court, a second train tunnel disappears into the  rock. cross the open court, Belloq sees his destination: a large,  brilliant white silk tent has been erected in the midst of  all this hardware. It looks incongruous, and more than a  little eerie. It is the Tabernacle. t the entrance to the second train tunnel, Indy and Marion  struggle to lift the Ark into a mine car. Marion has the  submachine gun slung over her back. The Ark drops heavily  into the bottom of the car. The noise attracts the attention  of five water-carrying Nazis. They see what's going on and  reach for their side-arms. Indy grabs Marion, pulls her in  front of him - as though to use her as a shield - and flips  the submachine gun, still on her back, toward the Nazis. dozen Nazis spin and look at the mine car. Marion is just  leveling the submachine gun. Indy pushes forward the throttle  and the mine car moves toward the tunnel, picking up speed.  As the Nazis raise their guns to fire, Marion and Indy both  open up, peppering the area with lead. As the mine car is  about to disappear into the tunnel - s the car disappears, bullets pock the entrance of the  tunnel. Shliemann runs up with three Nazis. They jump into  the next mine car and take off, disappearing into the tunnel. fuel drum, already pocked by bullets is finally penetrated  by high velocity hot lead. It explodes in a ball of flame.  And then its neighbor. Then all is exploding flame. huge dragon of all-consuming fire shoots up the tunnel  behind the Nazis, catches their car and incinerates Shliemann  and his men. The tunnel collapses in this section, burying  the fried Nazis forever. small Nazi transport launch, carefully disguised as a Greek  fishing boat, sits bobbing by the dock. The only human: a  Nazi Sentry dressed as a Greek peasant. He is perched on a  pile of seed bags which are stacked at the very end of the  train tracks. As the mine car barrels noisily down toward  him, he throws away some burlap to reveal a mounted machine  gun which he spins quickly around toward the approaching  mine car. He opens fire. t the machine gun post, the Nazi Sentry has been firing  like crazy, but now there is terror in his eyes. He realizes  the car is not going to stop. He lacks faith in his  stronghold. Too late. nd then we notice that the Little Old Government  Warehouseman, pushing his new crate ahead of him, has turned  into another aisle and disappeared from view."
3,indiana_jones_raiders,INDY,"No. We don't need them. We'll leave them. Once we've got it,  we'll be able to reach the plane by  dusk. If they knew we were here, they would  have killed us already. So this is where Forrestal cashed  in. Competitor. He was good, very good. No one ever had what we have...  partners. (back turned) Assuming that pillar there marks the  corner and... Let's go. Forrestal. Now, Satipo, we don't want to be  discouraged by every little thing. (taking torch) Let me see that. Try not to touch the vines. That's what scares me. You wait here. Adios. (eyeing the Hovitos) Too bad they don't know you like I  do, Belloq. (yelling) Get it going! Get it going! GO! I can't stand snakes. I hate them. I don't know. Just because Belloq  had it doesn't mean he kept it. Getting it away from those Indians  would be a neat trick (a hard look) I hope they got him. That's all right, Phil. Thanks a  lot. No. I'll see you Thursday. Hey, if you don't like them, I can  always return them. Then what's wrong? What kind of people? (concerned) Government? I've already served. (nods) We haven't spoken in ten years. I'm  afraid we had a bit of a falling  out. (negative) Just rumors. Somewhere in Asia, last  I heard. I understand. (to himself) Tanis. Ain't that somethin'! Ah, Ravenwood's no Nazi. They're looking for the headpiece to  the Staff of Ra. Only half of it. Ravenwood had the  other half. It all has to do with the Ark of the  Covenant. (the Army guys look  mystified) The chest the Hebrews used to carry  around the Ten Commandments. An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark  from Jerusalem and took it back to  the city of Tanis. A short time later,  Tanis was consumed by the desert in  a sandstorm that lasted a year. But  before that, the Pharaoh had had the  Ark hidden away in a secret chamber  called the Well of the Souls. Which  is where the Staff of Ra comes in. Now this was rather clever. The Staff  was really just a big stick - oh, I  don't know, say like this - (he indicates about  six feet) no one really knows for sure. Any  way, it was capped by an elaborate  headpiece with a carving of the sun  at the top. What you had to do was  take the Staff to a special map room  in Tanis - it had the whole city  laid out in miniature on the floor.  When you placed the Staff in a certain  spot in this room, at a certain time  of day, the sun would shine through  a hole here in the headpiece and  then send a beam of light down here -  to the map - giving you the location  of the Well of the Souls... (nods) Which is probably what the Nazis are  after. Look like? Why, it's right here... Yes. That's what the Hebrews thought. Who knows... lightning... fire...  the power of God. Oh yes. The Bible tells of it leveling  mountains and wasting entire regions.  Moses promised that when the Ark was  with you, ""your enemies will be  scattered and your foes fell before  you"". (pause) An army which carries the Ark before  it is invincible. Oh, there's one other thing that  Hitler undoubtably believes about  the Ark... (a long pregnant pause) It's said that the Lost Ark will be  recovered at the time of the coming  of the True Messiah. Most certainly. This isn't really a good time. All right. Come on in. I'll be in a minute. (smiles) Good work, Marcus. I had a feeling  this would happen. And, of course,  the Museum gets the Ark when we're  done. Okay, here's the way it's gonna be.  First, I'll high-tail it to Shanghai  and get the piece from General Hok.  Then I think I know where I can find  Ravenwood. If only I can get - I'll worry about that when the time  comes. My only hope is to find the  Well of the Souls before the Nazis  do. What's the hurry? (he's felt better) Great. Got it. I've got to get to Nepal. Hello, Marion. Nice to see you, too. (getting up) Take it easy. I'm looking for your  father. What happened? Do you find him? Not a bad way to go. Doing what he  loved. Why not leave? Go back to the States. Where you gonna get it? I need one of the pieces your father  collected. I never meant to hurt you. You knew what you were doing. I guess that depends on your  definition. Look, I did what I did. I don't expect  you to be happy about it. But maybe  we can do each other some good. Shut up and listen for a second. I  want that piece your father had.  I've got money. Enough to get you back to the States.  Where are his things? Everything? (giving up) That's too bad. Seltzer. You're a tough broad now, aren't  you? I can only say I'm sorry so many  times. A bronze piece, about this size. In  the shape of the sun. Probably broken  off at the bottom. Has a little hole  in it, off-center. Does that sound  familiar? Do you know where it is? Three thousand. American. Maybe. Okay, five thousand. That's all I  can give you now. I can get you more  when you land in the States. I'm back, aren't I? You can trust me. Why? I trust you. I've heard that. (moving back) Bossy, aren't you? Tomorrow. Hello. Let's get out of here! It's here? Forget it! I want you out of here.  Now! Let's go! (figuratively) I owe you plenty! (smiles) You're something! I knew the Germans would hire you,  Sallah. They couldn't have an  excavation in the desert without the  best digger in Egypt. Tell me about the map room at Tanis. Those Nazis are moving awfully fast. Belloq. So he got away from the  Indians. This is going to be more  interesting that I thought. (indicates the  headpiece) Even Belloq won't be able to find it  without that. Can you make anything  of those markings? They're nothing  I'm familiar with. What is it, my friend? Do you really need that monkey? And your brains. (dragging Marion on) He'll be OK. Come on. Come on. (to Marion) Run! Get out of here! Go, dammit! Go! Marion. (doesn't even look) Too bad. I'm drinking alone. Belloq. I ought to kill you right now. Not a very private place for a murder. Try the local sewer. Now you're getting nasty. What about your boss, der Fuhrer? I  thought he was waiting to take  possession. I hope your friends are patient.  Dangerous work, Belloq. Tell me, did you get away with the  idol? You know, if it's God you want to  talk to, maybe I can arrange it. Yes. Yes, I'll come now. (nods) Thanks you. (grave) Marion's dead. And they made the calculation in the  map room? (resigned) The Well of the Souls. Just want I need. How 'bout the height of the staff?  Did Belloq get it off of there? You said their top section was blank.  Are you absolutely sure? Belloq's staff is seven and a half  inches short. They're digging in the  wrong spot! My God! They aren't kidding! What time does the sun hit the map? We haven't got much time. Where are  the Germans digging for the Well of  the Souls? Okay. Let's go. (stage whisper) Sallah. (he waits, then louder) Sallah! (loudest) Sallah! I though you were dead. They must have switched baskets.  Thank god for that! Bless those  bastards. Have they hurt you? (putting the knife  away) I have to leave you here for a little  while. I know where the Ark is. If I  take you out of here they'll start  combing the place for us. Keep your voice down. Look, you don't know how glad I am  to see you. And I don't like doing  this. But the whole thing will be  shot if you don't just sit here  quietly. They haven't hurt you in  the last twenty-four hours, they  aren't going to start now. I'll be  back to get you in no time. There! The Ark must be in that stone case.  What's that gray stuff all over the  floor - Why snakes? Why did it have to be  snakes? Anything else. Lots of torches. And oil. I want a  landing strip down there. Don't touch it! Never touch it! Hurry up! Why did it have to be  snakes? What the - Why don't you fellows come down here?  I'll show you. Don't panic. There's plenty of time  for that later. Wave that at anything  that slithers. Just watch the floor. (he spots something) There! Come on! Stay here! I'll be back in a minute. We're going  through this wall. Just keep your eyes open and get  ready to run. No matter what happens  to me. Come on! I guess not. I think I'd be dead. Absolutely. Out. Don't do that. It scares me. Look! When the Ark gets loaded, we're  already going to be on that plane. Get out! Get out! Where is it? You two get back to Cairo quick and  get us transportation to England - a  plane, a ship, anything. I'm going to get that truck. I'll  meet you at Omar's. Be ready for me. (still searching) I don't know. I'm making this up as  I go. It's lovely. That's what you look like. What would you like to recapture? Did I ever say I was sorry I burned  down your tavern? You saved my life. Seems things have worked out kind of  even. Maybe we should consider all past  accounts closed. What else? The engines have shut down. I'm going to find out. What's wrong? Holy shit. Damn! Hold it. (the Nazi react) One move from anybody and I blow  that box back to Moses. What about you? Talked to God yet? (Belloq's eyes flash) Where's the girl? That depends on how reasonable we're  all willing to be. All I want is the  girl. We'll keep possession of the  Ark only till we've got safe transport  to England. Then it's all yours. Then the Ark and some of us are going  up in a big bang. I don't think Hitler  would like that a bit. Now I don't  want to talk about this anymore.  Show me that girl in five seconds or - It's a bad habit. I'm trying to break  it. Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him  I'm on my way up. Marion! Marion, can you hear me? Hi. Glad I could make it. Let's get out of here. Are you game? (grins at her) Okay. Let's do it. Whatever you do, don't touch it.  Let's put it on the floor. We'll go down that side. Shoot anyone  who looks at us crosseyed. (to Marion) Get down! (heated) That's a powerful force. Research  should be done - Who? We may be able to help. Yeah, like what? It's not the Ark... but it'll have  to do."
4,indiana_jones_raiders,S,"creenplay by tory by atipo watches this confrontation with some concern. atipo sees them and makes a frightened grunting sound. Indy  looks at him, sees what he's pointing at and casually brushes  all three spiders off with his rolled whip, as he would a  fly. Satipo pirouettes for an inspection and Indy flicks one  off the Peruvian's back. atipo watches, wide-eyed and mystified. atipo's eyes widen in terror. He turns and runs. atipo swings across the pit. He makes it just as the whip  comes undone from the beam, leaving Indy without an escape.  Satipo, extremely nervous, regards the whip a moment then  turns back to face Indy, who has run up to the far side of  the pit. atipo flies through like a chubby ballet dancer and takes  the steps five at a time. atipo has slowed down. He begins to edge carefully around  the light shaft. he is almost on him when Indy looks up smiling. Marion stops,  stares, shocked. he hits him with a solid right to the jaw, knocking him off  the barstool on the floor. He rubs his jaw and smiles up at  her. uddenly the hardness cracks. She is on the verge of tears  and does not want him to see them. She turns away and takes  a whiskey bottle from the shelf, then turns back to pout  herself a drink. he looks around the saloon. he pours herself another as Indy watches, amused. he breaks away from him, darts back and picks the hot  medallion up in the loose cloth of her blouse. he holds up the medallion possessively. allah finds it hard to say. When he finally speaks, his  words are accompanied by a strange, eerie, foreboding rush  of wind through the courtyard. Just a coincidence we might  suppose. uddenly the Arab patrons of the bar take an intense interest  in the situation, shifting their weapons. allah nods, moves to the food. He picks up a date, then  changes his mind and drops it, taking a bunch of grapes  instead. Indy picks up a chicken leg in one hand and a date  in the other, his mind distracted. Fayah enters the room  just in time to see Indy flip the date high into the air and  try to catch it in his mouth. It bounces off his chin and  falls to the floor. Indy looks sheepishly at Fayah. Fayah  picks up the fallen date and puts it in the dirty ash tray  she is now removing. Amir speaks in a slow, raspy voice  without looking up. allah nods. allah and Indy begin to laugh. Amir gives them a glance and  returns to his wine. Sallah leans over and kisses the old  man. allah points out into the desert a short way beyond the  main area of activity. The desert turns to sand dunes out  there, the surface undulating into the distance. Several  trucks and men are out there and a bulldozer is lumbering  noisily toward it. allah's truck drives through the camp, one of the Arab  Diggers at the wheel. Indy and Sallah are in the back and  look just like the other two Arab Diggers. Sallah's truck  does behind a tent and when it appears on the other side,  Indy and Sallah are gone. allah jumps about three feet. The JEEP GERMAN is standing  in an open space ten yards away looking at Sallah. allah gestures his innocence. allah watches nervously as his precious rope is pulled taut  between the pulling truck and the stuck jeep. He doesn't  notice that he has chosen to stand next to a large, steaming  kettle of food until - allah picks up some serving pieces and gets to work. allah, sweating profusely, has finished serving the line of  Breakfasting Germans and now heads back to replace the kettle  and get away. allah glances at Indy, Then hurries back in that direction.  The Hungry German focuses on Indy. hliemann signals Gobler, who steps outside the tent a moment,  calls someone and then reappears. Belloq looks warily at the  entrance. After a moment Belzig enters, reeking villainy.  When his eyes find Shliemann, his superior, he snaps a crisp  ""Heil, Hitler!"" at him, holding his palm rigid a long time,  exposing a burned scar in the prefect shape of the sun  medallion. allah is mesmerized by the sight. His hand starts to reach  out and touch one of the angels, but Indy grabs it. allah takes the next rope and climbs quickly out of the  Well. Indy has picked up a torch and now throws it at a pool  of snakes who are too close for his comfort. He turns and  takes hold of the exit rope. He gives it a first tug and it  falls down into the Well, landing partly beyond the ring of  fire where is instantly disappears in a tangle of angry,  hissing asps. Indy looks up at the hole. miling down at him from the perimeter of the entry are  Belloq, Shliemann and Gobler. unlight is flooding this tableau: Sallah, Omar and his men  are being held at bay by ten armed Nazis. The wooden crate  sits safely nearby. Belzig and another Nazi have the gagged  Marion held in their rough grasp. hliemann smiles down at Indy. hliemann glances meaningfully around at the other Nazis. nakes are moving in force up the pillar toward Indy's  dwindling torch. Indy grasps the pillar for dear life,  grimaces with exertion and pushes against the wall with all  he's got. The pillar begins to break loose of the ceiling,  then stops. Indy's eyes are on the torch. It is just a spot  of flame now. Snakes are sliding up toward his hands. Indy  again pushes against the wall and the torch falls out of his  mouth. allah gestures to follow and all three run off stealthily  through the mostly deserted camp. allah, Indy and Marion run into a hiding spot behind some  water barrels near the Command Tent. They peek out at this  activity - allah and Marion look at Indy. Belloq and Shliemann climb  in the back seat of the front car and the caravan pulls out.  Indy watches it go, thinking hard. allah nods. Marion looks at him like he's nuts. Indy jumps  up, looks around desperately. he turns so their lips are very close. he looks into his eyes. A smile jumps from her lips to his.  He kisses her and they sink slowly to the cot. hliemann considers. hliemann nods and continues to stare at the Bantu Wind, as  does the Captain. The Pirate crew is all lined across the  bow. Towering above the others, standing on the rail, proud  and defiant, is Katanga. Shliemann looks at the Wurrfler's  Captain a moment. hliemann mulls this, then turns to the hatch. hliemann disappears down the hatch. The Captain is very  pleased. A Radioman speaks into his headset, then follows  the other Aides down the hatch. In the distance the other  subs begin to move away from the ship. The Captain, alone on  the bridge, looks once more at Katanga. everal shark fins cut the surface, appearing and disappearing  in the bright moonlight. They are shadowing - hliemann looks a little unhappy about this exchange, but  says nothing. The group moves swiftly toward the end of a  mine train arrangement. The train, consisting of small,  separate, electric-powered cars, sits on a track which  disappears into a tunnel cut in the rock. hliemann doesn't like any of his alternatives. He looks at  Belloq with some suspicion as the train comes into bright  light. hliemann makes it clear to the other Nazis that Indy is to  be obeyed. hliemann draws his Luger. hliemann raises the pistol. hliemann eyes Belloq, then the Ark. He lowers the pistol,  motions for the Nazis to take Indy out ahead of him. They  stop a moment only when Belloq speaks. hliemann motions them out and follows. Belloq turns back to  the Ark, raising the ivory rod. hliemann, the Tall Captain, Indy and the two Nazis holding  him emerge from the Tabernacle. Shliemann points to a nearby  wall and the group starts that way with Shliemann and the  Tall Captain slightly ahead. hliemann, hand on his eyes, aims his Luger blindly at the  scuffle. Indy pushes the Tall Captain at Shliemann, who fires  on impact, killing the Tall Captain. Indy knocks out  Shliemann. uddenly, Indy looks as - hliemann spins around and looks at the tunnel entrance. He  points at Indy and Marion, who have just hopped into the  mine car with the Ark. hliemann, sensing victory, smiles evilly and carefully takes  aim. Indy and Marion will be easy targets until they reach  that approaching low cross beam, which is the crest of the  rising tunnel. hliemann and his cohorts hear the explosions behind them  and look back that way."
5,indiana_jones_raiders,B,"arranca looks evilly at Indy's hand upon him. Indy releases  him and smiles in a friendly way. arranca is suddenly on his feet, quietly drawing his pistol.  He raises it toward Indy as Satipo realizes with alarm what  he's doing. Too late. Indy's head turns and he sees Barranca. elloq extends his hand. Indy looks at it, then produces the  idol and hands it to Belloq. Belloq extends his other hand,  smiling. Indy hands over his gun. Belloq sticks it in his  jacket. rody is excited. He looks at Indy. rody and Indy exchange a look as they all shake and Brody  starts to leave with the Army men. rody enters the book-lined, dark-wooded study. He paces for  a moment before the fire which is dying in the fireplace,  then spots something and goes over to Indy's big desk. The  surface is covered with open books, monographs, maps and  drawings - all about the Ark of the Covenant. Brody smiles;  he knows his friend very well. Indy comes in, closing the  door behind him. Brody turns to him with a triumphant  expression. ehind the gong, Indy gauges his move. As the gong is about  to be stopped by a marble bench, Indy talks a long stride  onto the bench and dives through the glass of the high window.  Hok's bullets hit the wall. elzig's smile fades at this news. He's not a patient sort.  Marion is chilled by the look. She turns and moves to the  shelf of bottles behind her, reaching high for one, very  near the large stuffed raven. He hand lingers there a moment  and we see - elzig gives her a cold look then turns and walks over toward  the fireplace. As soon as his back is turned, the Second  Nazi grabs the nearest whiskey bottle and takes a quick pull.  In so doing, he leaves the medallion completely exposed.  Marion is aware of this as she looks at him. But he quickly  puts the bottle down again, obscuring the medallion, when  Belzig speaks from the fireplace. elzig, still looking in the fire, sneers and shakes his  head. elzig turns from the fireplace. In his hand is the poker,  its end glowing orange. He advances on Marion. Marion stops  yelling, her eyes widen in terror. elzig has no intention of stopping now. The glowing tip is  approaching Marion's face. The Nepalese watches with savage  glee. elzig and the Second German dive behind tables near the  bar. The Nepalese is slower to leave Marion, he draws a Luger.  Indy's .45 barks and the Nepalese dies spinning against the  bar. Indy fires in the direction of the Mongolian. oth the Giant Sherpa and Indy hear this. The Giant Sherpa  exchanges an alarmed look with Indy and together they swing  the .45 around toward the surprised Second Nazi. Two blasts  blow him away. elzig now has a clear shot at Indy. He raises his luger. elzig runs for cover as Marion gets control of the gun and  levels it. Belzig dives around the end of the bar opposite  Marion. When he has set himself, he peeks up over the edge  of the scorched bar. The alcohol fire has moved down the bar  and now, much to Belzig's surprise, he finds himself staring  at the fire-blackened sun-shaped medallion! elzig has had enough. In excruciating pain, he turns, sees  a window, runs and dives through the glass. elzig has his burned hand stuck deep in the snow. Now he  withdraws it, steaming, and scurries off into the night like  a wounded animal. elloq leans forward, eyes shining, voice suddenly different. elloq glances into the gloom at the German Henchmen. elloq, SHLIEMANN the ranking Nazi, and Shliemann's Aide,  GOBLER, come into the tent, which is full of charts and maps,  drawings of the Ark, radio equipment, liquor and food. The  men have been out digging for the Well all day. They are  tired, discouraged, testy. In all matters, Gobler shows his  alliance with Shliemann against Belloq with small looks and  body language. The Frenchman has disappointed them and he is  feeling the isolation of a scapegoat. Belloq gets himself a  drink as Shliemann towels off his face. elloq shoots him an angry look. elloq has been talking to the still-bound Marion. He has  removed her gag. He is impatient, angry, uncomfortable. Caught  between two forces. elloq and the Germans laugh. elzig and the Nazi move Marion to the hole and, to Belloq's  surprise, push her in. Marion falls thirty feet screaming.  Indy drops his torch, braces, and catches her! Her weight  knocks him to the ground, almost into the snakes. She looks  around at the snakes, clinging to him more desperately as he  struggles to his feet trying to unload her. elloq feels how much he is the outsider, his own  vulnerability. He backs down with the wisdom of survival. He  turns to look down at Indy and Marion. His manner is gallant. elloq and the others step back from the hole and unseen  Nazis slam the heavy stone door into place. Marion screams.  Her scream is accompanied by - ehind the water barrels, Sallah and Marion exchange hapless  looks, But Indy just concentrates on - elloq and Shliemann regard him suspiciously. elloq steps forward and puts a proprietary hand on Marion's  arm, fixing Shliemann with a steady look. ack in the central area, Shliemann and the other Nazis are  taken aback by Belloq's appearance in the robe. They exchange  looks. From one knot of men there is muttering about ""Juden""  and such, but when Belloq turns a fiery gaze on them there  is immediate silence. Shliemann looks uncertain in this  presence. elloq approaches the Ark. He stops a few feet from it and  begins murmuring an invocation in Hebrew. After a few moments  of this he advances a step and is about to place the ivory  rod in a notch under the lid of the Ark itself. The end of  the rod is an inch from the notch when - elloq has the ivory rod inserted in the notch under the lid  of the Ark. He utters a short phrase in Hebrew and begins to  press down on his end of the rod. The lid of the Ark begins  to lift. It's difficult work. Belloq puts his whole weight  into one big press on his end and the lid opens two feet. linding arcs of light shoot out across the Tabernacle  instantly killing all the Nazis inside and turning the white  silk to flame. But it is Belloq in his obsession who takes  the full blast. His whole body seems lit by a million volt  current and, for a moment, his complete form is white, then  blue, then maybe green, but it is hard to tell because our  eyes are blinded now too. Two aspects of this ghastly,  beautiful display are somehow communicated in the chaos,  although the communication is subliminal. First, that Belloq,  in the instant of his destruction, has experienced some kind  of sublime, transcendental knowledge. If a death's-head can  smile and look satisfied, that is how Belloq's incandescent  face would be described. Secondly, this event is accompanied  by a sound like no other. A sound so intense and so odd and  so haunting that the suggestible among us might imagine it  were the whisper of God. ehind Indy, the brilliant light and weird noise of the Ark  have suddenly ceased, but the Tabernacle is ablaze and the  fire has quickly spread to stacks of supplies on either side.  Smoke is already starting to fill the cavern. Nazis are  running around, yelling for firefighting water. A burning  crate at the side of the Tabernacle is pushed over, only to  knock over a drum of heavy black oil. A river of flame shoots  across the cement."
6,indiana_jones_raiders,M,"usgrove and Eaton exchange a look; they're disappointed. usgrove takes a sheet from his briefcase. ahdlo is hesitant, but lays the axe handle on the bar and  goes out. Indy has been barely aware of him. Now he settles  again on the barstool. Marion has a vindictive look. She'll  let him stay, but she wants to inflict as much pain as  possible. arion's eyes go icy. She swings at him again with her right,  but this time he catches her at the wrist. Then he stops her  left, which she has brought up to slap him. arion nods. arion looks at him thoughtfully, takes a drink. arion thinks, nods slowly. arion sneers and they smile together. arion stands before the fire that is shrinking in the  fireplace. She jabs at it abstractedly with a poker, thinking.  Suddenly tears well up in her eyes. She lets the poker slip  from her hand, wipes away the tears. She walks across the  room to the end of the bar, still cluttered with bottles and  glasses, and stops at the pile of American money Indy has  left. She takes the chain from around her neck and lets the  medallion slide off it into her hand. She places it on the  bar next to the pile of money, thinking. Then, having reached  some decision, she picks up the pile of bills, walks up the  back of the bar and pulls a small wooden box from under the  bar. She flips open the top, puts the cash inside and closes  the top. She leaves the box on the bar and starts back toward  the medallion. The front door of the saloon bursts open and  Four Bad Men come in. Marion, halfway between the valuable  possessions and not wishing to draw attention to either,  stops where she is. arion shakes her head. arion opens the bottle before Belzig, who watches her  intently. arion swings up over the top of her bar. Belzig fires at  her, but his bullets smash bottles behind the bar and thud  into the raven. arion flattens out on the floor behind the bar as bullets  hit above her. She reaches up, snatches the axe handle from  where Mahdlo left it, and begins crawling down the length of  the bar toward - arion, at the end of the bar, finally gets the hand of the  Mongolian's submachine gun. It roars to life in the general  direction of the ceiling. arion throws down the empty submachine gun and moves through  the flames to the center of the bar where she left the box  with the five grand. She finds the remains of the box and  its contents: a shapeless pile of ash and charred wood. arion stands beneath her stuffed raven with the Baretta. arion nods, kicks aside a burning chair. Another burning  beam falls from the roof. Indy pulls Marion close to him  protectively. onkey Man quickly leaves the two German Agents and gets  back to the street. He is obviously shadowing Indy and Marion.  Indy and Marion are just now passing by the Monkey Man ducks  back behind some baskets. arion goes. She runs off between two buildings. A Bad Arab  takes off after her. Monkey Man, now standing at the edge of  the square, points at Marion. The Monkey jumps off his  shoulder and follows Marion. arion runs along the narrow space and soon encounters a  five foot wall. She flops over it. The Bad Arab is right on  her heels. He reaches the wall and vaults over. On the other  side of the wall, the Bad Arab lands in a crouch, looks ahead  and doesn't see Marion. Immediately a heavy earthen pot  smashes over his head, putting him out. Marion steps from an  alcove and starts to run toward the street at the other end  of the walkway. Suddenly another Bad Arab and a new German  Agent appear in the street at that end. Before they can spot  her, Marion retreats to the alcove again. There is a huge  rattan basket sitting there. Marion climbs in and closes the  top above her. ore waiting. Nothing. Indy looks around for some alternative  means of escape. The room doesn't offer any. He looks up at  the skylight again. arion's frightened look shifts suddenly to the entrance of  the tent. There are new arrivals there - Shliemann, Gobler  and Belzig. Belzig carries a black leather case. He steps  forward and smiles at Marion. arion is frozen in her spot. Indy drags her after him. He  splashes oil the rest of the way to the wall. It lights and  Indy pulls Marion over to the wall. He pours the remaining  oil in a circle around them, creating a safe zone there. arion looks at the wall, which looks like all the rest to  her. She thinks he's crazy. arion gives him a look. They round a corner and begin a  walk through a maze of chambers that present for their  inspection: moldering mummies and stacked sarcophagi; a room  decorated with a thousand human skulls; a wall crawling with  huge scarabaeid beetles. Marion is quite naturally a nervous  wreck; she jumps when Indy grabs her suddenly and points. arion is struggling with the top of the cockpit. She can't  budge it. She's trapped. arion thinks about this a long time. arion awakes with a start, alone in the cot. Something's  wrong. The ship is quiet. Indy is strapping on his holster.  He pulls his ship and jacket from a hook. arion nods. Each taking an end with the poles, they lift  the Ark from the altar and lower it to the floor. Marion  grunts under the weight. Indy registers this, hands her the  submachine gun. He pulls out his whip, motions her back, and  sweeps the whip tightly around the body of the Ark. The whip  wraps snugly around the plaiting and Indy ties it off. The  Ark is now harnessed to the whip handle. Indy gives it an  experimental pull and the Ark slides across the smooth cement.  Indy indicates the direction of the second train tunnel. arion makes a face, then puts her arms around his neck and  plants a humdinger of a kiss on his mouth. It goes on a while.  Finally they break."

See, right by their bedroom window. Oh, right. Right. You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done. Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr. Yeah. What if they don't like me? No, really. You remember how we met? Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'  Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go? [gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside, you, right now. No! Coral! Coral? Coral? Oh! Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...Nemo. I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes. Okay...huh? All right, I'm up. Nemo! [gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. All right, where's the break? You feel a break? Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids? Are you woozy? How many stripes do I have? Answer the stripe question! No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh, you're okay. How's the lucky fin? Let's see. Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years. Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush. Do you want this anemone to sting you? Brush. You missed a spot. There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here! All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes, if you wanna do it four times-- All right. Come on, boy.  No, and I don't plan to. Sea turtles? I don't know. Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin, hold my fin. Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go. Come on, we'll try over there. Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher? Yes. Shocking, I know. Marlin. Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them   were walking, so forget that I-- I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds. That's where I would play He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin. Whoa, you better stay with me. Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes. Bye, Nemo! Bye, son! Be safe. Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you? They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you, insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!? Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy! Nemo, no! You were about to swim into open water! It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know-- This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out there. You know you can't swim well. No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two. Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things but you just can't, Nemo! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little too soon for him to be out here unsupervised. Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me? Don't touch the bo--Nemo! You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big...big-- I'm coming, Nemo! Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo! Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no! Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please! Waaaah! Ooh, ooh... He's gone, he's gone.. He's gone. No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat. You have? A white one? Where!? Which way!?  Hey! Wait! What? Huh? Wait a minute.. What? You're showing me which way the boat went! Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going! If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish! Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this! Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps] Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Parties are fun, and it's tempting but-- O-okay..that's all that matters. Me? I don't have a problem. Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish-- Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the sea mollusk says to the cucumber... Nemo! No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers. Ugh! What do these markings mean? I can't read human. No, no, no, Dory! No, Dory! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay? I'm so sorry. Ohh... Dory, look out! /DORY Aaaaaaaah! There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape! Dory, help me find a way out! There's gotta be a way out! Let's go!  Well, then here. Read this now! Oh no, it's blocked! I need to get that mask! No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick grab the mask! Nemo. Nemo. [mutters] Huh? No, no! What does it say? Dory! Wake up! Get up! Come on! Come on!  /DORY AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! [gasps] The mask! Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask! Get the mask! Get it! It's gone. I've lost the mask. You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone. I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down. Dory, no singing. See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head! Dory, do you see anything? That was me. I'm sorry. Who could it be? It's me! Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything? A light. No, I see it too. What is it? I'm feeling...happy. Which is a big deal for me. Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone. I can't see! I don't know where I'm going! The mask! Oh, gee! Read it! Just read it! P. Sherman doesn't make any sense! Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah! Waah! Waaah! Waaaah! That's great! Speed read! Take a guess! No pressure! No problem! There's a lot of pressure! Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure! Duck! I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead. Whoo-hoo! [singing] We did it, we did it! Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! No eating here tonight, whoo! Dory. Dory! What did the mask say? Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that? /DORY Aaah! Excuse me. Ex-excuse me, um, hi. Do you know how to get to--hello? W-w-w-wait! Can you tell me--hey! Hold it! Wait a minute! I'm trying to talk to you. Okay, fellas, come back here. Please, one quick question. I need to aaaaand they're gone again. [sighs] Okay, all right. Here's the thing. Y'know, I just, I-I think it's best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by..by myself. Y'know, alone. Without, without..well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it's just that I don't want you... with me. I don't wanna hurt your feelings.. Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'. No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you. No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how I can get to-- It's a swordfish. [coughs up answer]Lobster. What? Will somebody please give me directions? I'm serious. Thank you. What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name. Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there. Nemo. But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me. [gasps] Great! That's great! Dory, you did it! Well, listen fellas, thank you. Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing. Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it. And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go. Trust you? Look! Something shiny! Oh, it just swam over the trench. Come on, we'll follow it. Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time. You wanted to go through the trench. Dory! That's a jellyfish! Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see. I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look. It did. It's just that.. ..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings. Come here. It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we? That we don't wanna touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one.[gasps] /DORY Aaaah! Don't move! This is bad, Dory. [gasps] Dory! Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you, that's it! Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game. A game. Yes. All right, here's the game. Um, whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins. Rules, rules, rules! You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops. W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait! Dory! [gasps] Dory! Wait a minute--whoa! Dory! So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time. I can do this, just be careful. Oh, I don't think so! The question is, Dory, are you hungry? Yeah, 'cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish is the winner! Woohoo! We did it! We're gonna...Dory? Oh no. Dory! Dory! Dory! [gasps] Dory! Uggghhh! No, you're doing fine! You're, you're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Uh, where does P. Sherman live? That's it! Oww! Ow! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ow! Stay awake! Stay--awake! Awake... Awake...wake up...Nemo... Ooh... Ooooh... Ooooh..what happened? What're you talking about? Ooh. Ooh..ooh, my stomach. Ooooh.. So Mr. Turtle... Crush? Really? Okay Crush, listen I need to get to the East Australian Current. EAC? Grabbing--waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Whooooooaaaa!!! Stop! Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney. [gasps] Dory! Dory! Is she all right!? Dory, Dory! Dory! Oh, Dory. I-I-I'm so sorry. This is all my fault, it's my fault... Huh? [gasps] Oh my goodnes! Well, apparently, I must've done something you all like. Heh, uh, dudes. Ow. All by themselves? But-but-but dude, how do you know when they're ready? W-w-wai-wait-- Hold on, I need to breath-- One at a time! Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me. No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it. [sighs] Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long long way from here. And my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on   him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. So we swam   out in the ocean to follow them... Where!? I don't see it! You mean the swirling vortex of terror!? Of course it is. It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you're really cute! But I don't know what you're saying! Say the first thing again! /DORY Aaaaaaaaaah!!! Weeeeeeeeeeee!!! Whoooooooooooaaaaa!!! Aaaaaaaaaaah!!! Woohoooo!!! Whoooooaaa!!!  No worries! Thank you, dude Crush! Oh, Nemo would've loved this. Hey, ooh! Hey, Crush! Crush, I forgot! How old are you? Hundred and fifty! Hundred and fifty, I gotta remember that. Yup. Yup. We're gonna just swim straight. Dory? Boy, this is taking a while. Okay. It's me. It's me. Me. And the next one's just a guess: me. W-w-wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight! We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me! Wha--? Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here! Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out our bones! Look, I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the 'Let's Not Die' card. Of course, I do. All right. Ha..hello. Nemo. Sydney. Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella. Uh, Dory..what're you doing? What're you doing? Are you sure you speak whale? Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away. He's not coming back. You offended him. Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach. No, don't try humpback. Okay, you actually sound sick. Don't do that! It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard! It's just as well, he might be hungry. Move, Dory! Move! Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Ooof! Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Would you just stop it!? We're in a whale! Don't you get it!? A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here! No, you're insane! You can't speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! [sobs] No. No, it won't. No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him. What? What's going on? Dory. Dory. ..AAAAAAAAAAT'SSS-GOOIIIIIIING.. Dory. Of course, we've stopped. Just stop trying to speak whale, you're gonna make things worse. [gasps] What is that noise? Oh no. Look what you did. The water's going down! It's-it's-it's going down! Look, it's already half-empty! Stop that! It's half-empty! Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!? Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch! Stop talking to him--waaaah! What is going on!? No! No more whale! You can't speak whale! No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo! Dory!  /DORY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Ha ha ha! We're alive! You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son! THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK-YOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUU-SIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! Okay. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him. Come on, Dory. We can do this! No, but the boat has to be here somewhere! Come on, Dory, we're gonna find it. Dory, wake up, wake up. Come on. That's not a duck. It's a--pelican! Whooooaaaaah! No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast! I gotta find my son Nemo! Dory, keep going! He's crazy! Hop in your mouth, huh? And how does that make me live? Yeah, right. That's Nemo! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! /DORY Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Where's Nemo!? Where is he!?  Oh yes, you can! Charge! [gasps] Nemo. Nemo! Dory. If it wasn't for you, I never even would have made it here. So, thank you. It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone and I'm going home now. I'm sorry, Dory, but I do. Sorry. Just trying to get home. Nemo? Nemo? Dory? [gasps] Nemo! Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo! Nemo! Oh, thank goodness! It's all right, son. It's gonna be okay. Move! Move! Dory! No, no, no! No! Dory! Nemo! No! Get out of there, now! No, I am not gonna lose you again! You're right. I know you can. Now go! Hurry! Well!? You heard my son! Come on! ..swim down together! Do you understand what I'm saying to you!? Swim down! down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down! Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! Just keep swimming! Keep swimming! You're doing great, son! Come on! Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming! Almost there! Keep swimming! Oww! Dory! Where's Nemo!? Oh no. Nemo! Nemo? Nemo? It's okay. Daddy's here, daddy's got you. Oh, thank goodness. No, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo. Hey, guess what? Sea turtles? I met one! And he was a hundred and fifty years old. Yep. Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as Sandy Plankton!? He was a hundred and fifty! Not one hundred! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything? Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Go! I'm gonna win! Oh! My own son beats me! So just then, the sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says : 'with fronds like these, who needs anemones?'! Bye, son! Have fun! I love you too, son. Sorry! Now go have an adventure! Nemo. Bye, son."

Just think about what you need to do. Perfect. Yeah. I'm thinking, tonight, we give the kid a proper reception. State your name. Brother Bloat, proceed. From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait. Welcome, brother Sharkbait! Enough with the Sharkbait. Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed? We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do? I'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help him escape. We're all gonna escape! 'Cause we've got him. You see that filter? You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me? /NEMO [sighs] He's fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think? You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait? Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you. Peach, any movement? Keep on him. My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet. All drains lead to the ocean, kid. Aah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to 'ya. That's your cue, Sharkbait. Okay, you gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber and I'll talk you through the rest. Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp. Nicely done! Can you hear me? Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening? Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. Careful, Sharkbait. He'll be fine. Try again. That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady. That's great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out. Sharkbait! Get 'im outta there! Get 'im outta there! Stay calm, kid! Just don't panic! Sharkbait! Grab hold of this! Feed me more! Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it! Pull! No. We're done. Hey, Sharkbait. No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean. I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid. Really? Three sharks!? He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait. [gasps] [gasps] Sharkbait! Sharkbait! We'll help you, kid! Can you hear me, Sharkbait!? Nemo! Can you hear me!? Sharkbait, you did it! That took guts, kid.  No cleaning. Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it. Good work. Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning! He he! Did you hear that, Sharkbait? Are you ready to see your dad, kid? Of course you are. Y'know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbor waitin' for you right now. Boss must've installed it last night while we were sleepin'. What's it say, Peach? I can't hear you, Peach. Stay down, kid! I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin'. [gasps] Nemo! Hold on! I'm comin'! Swim down! Come on, kid! Swim down! Come on! That's it! Good work! [gasps] Nemo!  Just calm down, Nemo. You won't go belly up, I promise. You're gonna be okay. Sharkbait! [gasps] He's still alive! He's gonna get flushed down the toilet! He's gonna get outta here! Oh no, not the trash can! He's over there! Quick! To the top of Mt. Wannahockaloogie! Bloat! Ring of Fire! Sharkbait. Tell your dad..I said..hi. Go get 'em. Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean. Come on, Peach! You can do it!"

Do you know the  Cullen family? No... well, a little. ... Okay. Mom, where's your cell?  You got me new tires. No one's  ever done that before. I mean... nothing. An animal? Be careful. And thank you. For the tires. Terrific. I'm... yes. You've been gone. Prophase. (muttering) Like I said. Seriously? You're asking me about the  weather? No. I don't like the cold. Or the  wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or  turtle necks.  'S POV - ECU ON EDWARD'S FACE It's complicated. My mother remarried. Phil is fine. Young for her, but  nice enough.  No... I -- I just.. . Did you get contacts?  - sitting on a gurney, the E.R. DOCTOR looking into her  eyes with a pen light. On the next gurney over, Tyler, the  van's driver, lies with a mild head wound. Charlie rushes up. I'm fine, dad. Calm down. It's okay, Tyler. Dad, it's not his fault- But you didn't. It would have been a lot worse if Edward  hadn't knocked me out of the way. It was amazing he got to me so  fast. He was nowhere near me. You told her?! She's probably freaking. 'S POV - EDWARD, ROSALIE, AND DR. CULLEN Can I talk to you for a moment? (off his nod) How did you get over to me so quickly? You were next to your car, across  the lot. Yes. You were. I know what I saw. You stopped that van. You pushed it away. I wasn't planning to tell anyone. I just want to know the truth.  No. Why did you even bother? (V.O. ) That was the first night I dreamed  of Edward Cullen.. . ... Yeah, false alarm.. . 'S POV - ACROSS THE LAWN (realizing, horrified) Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you  should ask Jessica. Hello, Edward. Really? How did you know about that? You haven't answered any of mine.  You won't even say hello. And how did you stop that van?  No way. Zero weirdness. You guys  are great together.  (cont'd) You could have let the van crush me  and saved yourself all this regret. I know you do. Your fault, for telling her about  the accident. He is. Should I know what that means? I'll go if you stop saying that. Thanks... but your mood swings are  giving me whiplash. What does that even mean? So let's say, for argument's sake,  that I'm not smart. Would you talk  to me? Tell me the truth? Okay... how �bout radioactive  spiders? Kryptonite? (beat, looking closer at him) No. I don't believe that. You're  not bad. You can be a jerk, but  it's like this... mask. To keep  people away. Look, why don't we just - hang out.  Like... come to the beach with us.  It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn,  salt water stinging your eyes.. . La Push. Is something wrong with that beach? You could ask him.  (off Angela's flustered Guys, this is Jacob. Are you  stalking me? Definitely not. (embarrassed) To be polite. You know them? You want to go look at tide pools? So, what did your friend mean about  the Cullens not coming here? I can keep a secret.. . Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? So the legend about the Cullens is.. . Didn't they just move here? Riiiight. So what was this treaty? Wait... what were they really? They just... ditch? It's a family thing. Port Angeles?.. .  (a plan forming in her  mind) Can I go with you guys? (absently) It looks great.  Look, just take my bag. What -- no, how did you find --  ? No. Bad idea. And you do? Okay, well. Thank you. (debates, then decides) I could eat. You're not eating? Like South Beach? So how �bout some answers? I didn't ask for the square root of pi. How did you know where I was? Were you following me? So that's a yes? (putting everything together) You said before... That you heard  what those guys were thinking.. .  Can you... read minds?  Why, what's wrong with me? What is it? Edward, you don't have to. Edward  - I think I'm warm enough now. Your hand, it's still freezing cold.  He died? How? The same kind that killed the security  guard down in Mason? So it's getting closer to town. But that's  - Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon. That's probably not a good  - 'S POV - EDWARD AND HIS SIBLINGS -- cross the lawn, heading to class. Edward sees Bella, sees  the intensity on her face. He stops. You're impossibly fast. And strong.  Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold.  Your eyes change color. And  sometimes you speak like... you're  from a different time. How old are you? How long have you been seventeen? I know what the Cold Ones are.  What you are. ... Vampire No. You won't hurt me. You're different. Where are we going? No! The sunlight will kill you. Slow down. No. I'm not afraid. No! Edward? Where are you? You're... beautiful.. . I don't believe that. I don't care. It doesn't matter. I trust you. I trust you, Edward. I'm here. Edward? (realizing) Oh... I thought you hated me when we met. I know you can. I'm afraid. Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll  disappear. That I'll lose you. Stupid lamb. (V.O. ) About three things I was absolutely  positive. One, Edward was  a  vampire. (V.O. ) Two, there was a part of him that  thirsted for my blood. And three.. . 'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY (V.O. ) ... I was falling, unconditionally  and irrevocably, in love with him. How long have you been like this? Where'd he find you? (V.O. ) What was it like? (V.O. ) Didn't he just... bite? (V.O. ) But Carlisle did. Does someone have to be dying to  become like you?.. . So Carlisle's the reason why you  hunt animals, instead of people. Show off. Can they all read minds, too?  Your house? With your family? But... what if they don't like me? I'm glad I amuse you. What is it? Come to visit your truck? A person did that? It's... wonderful. EDWARD You expected turrets, dungeons and moats?  BELLA No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside. Bon giorno? Oh, absolutely  - I just assumed -- because you don't  eat, you know.. . I would never, ever tell anyone. ... Badly?  (extending her hand) And you're Jasper, right? Graduation caps? What a nightmare, repeating high school. So you're obsessed with music. But.. . (looking around) No bed? Ever? Depends. Alternative? Jazz?  Sixties, seventies.. . I'd have to say... Debussy. No dancing. No tripping, no falling, no derision. You don't scare me. Don't you dare - In theory. Sorry I'm late. Biology project. Order one for yourself next time.  You should cut back on the steak. Yeah, me, too. He's just a friend. We're not really going to talk  about boys, are we?  So spring training's going well? Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me. (small smile) Maybe.. . (trying to avoid lies) Well... he is kind of a history buff. I, uh... have to go. I'll call you later, Mom. How did you get in here? You've been here before? You're a peeping Tom! Perv! (mortified) Oh... I'm... oh. Wish I could say the same. I'm so  embarrassed. I have a date with Edward Cullen. We're both juniors. I thought you  liked the Cullens. Edward doesn't live �in town.� And  it's in the early stage and - - whatever, he's outside right now. He wants to meet you. Officially. Be nice, okay? He's... important.  No fair, reading Charlie's mind. And since when do vampires like baseball? (to Esme) Now I get why you need the thunder. That has to be a home run. Yer out?  I said, leave me alone! Get out! It's over. I have to get out of this place.  Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now. (a pained whisper) I can't hurt him. No, Dad. I broke up with him. That's why I have to leave. I don't  want this. I want to go home. She'll come home. I'll call her  from the road. I want to drive. I need time to  think. I'll pull into a motel in  a  few hours. I promise.   His face... I said the same words  my mother used when she left him.  If any of you get hurt because of me  -  They could get hurt. It's not  worth it. How do the visions work? Edward  said they weren't always certain. So the course James is on now will  lead him to... a ballet studio? No. I don't know. I used to take  ballet lessons as a kid. The  school had an arch like that. Yeah, around the corner from my house.  But I haven't been there in ten years. No. Hell, no. I hated the place. Edward. Are you alright?  No... we can't. (then) When will you get here? Mom, I'm so glad you got my - - Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine,  okay? I'll explain every  - ... Mom? Are you there? Leave my mother out of this.

2,twilight,S,"tephenie Meyer uddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither  bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near. he stares at the cactus in a state of reverie, until lowly, the clouds start getting more numerous, thicker, darker.. .  until we're completely immersed in them... the sun disappearing. Finally, we EMERGE from the clouds to find below  - he just nods. Silence. he beams. It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her. She rushes to the truck. Jacob eagerly joins her. o, you're from Arizona, right?  Aren't people supposed to be tan  down there? uddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from  across the room. His eyes meet Bella's. But he seems.. .  confused. Bella quickly looks away. he can see EDWARD'S HANDS under the table. Clenched into fists. Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure.. . everal LOGGERS at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles. She  shrinks in her seat at the attention. Charlie's oblivious. he now only glances at Rosalie's car, a red M3 BMW, as it drives past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward. Bella returns to  her friends, finally forgetting about him.. . he heads toward her seat, brushing off her hair. But she  freezes when she sees --Edward. he's too shocked that he's talking to her to answer. he grabs the microscope defensively and snaps the first slide  in, adjusting the lens. She's curt as she addresses him. he glances at him but he just leans far away, his face  tight. She looks back into the microscope. he begins to remove the slide. he slides him the microscope. He glances through the lens. he glances at him, and this time sees a smirk. She simply  holds out her hand for another slide. hivering, Bella heads for her truck, carrying the onion,  carefully navigating the icy puddles. As she reaches her  truck, she looks across the lot he won't be bullied. Steps closer to him. he turns back to him. he turns to storm off but she stumbles over the irrigation  hose. Edward steadies her, catching her scent -- still so  powerful... He clenches his jaw. he just looks at him like he's crazy. He walks away as Jessica suddenly rushes up. he continues upstairs, glancing at her parents' WEDDING PHOTO. Off Bella's FACE, we MATCH CUT - - tartled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches  it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into  his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin.  He presents it to her with small smile. he notes her own, very human friends monitoring this  conversation from their table. Mike glowers jealously. he looks up to see three Quileute boys approaching the group;  Jacob Black, and SAM and EMBRY. Bella smiles at Jacob. he offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile. He grins,  infatuated. As they head toward the water.. . uddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly SILENCE themselves. The  dog raises his head, starts to GROWL. Waylon doesn't notice. he looks down to find Jessica sitting on the grass. he was right about this halter, he looks to her left; the other TWO GUYS are there. She's cornered. She takes her purse from around her shoulder. he takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her  wrist to use her purse as a mace. They chortle derisively.  But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in  the groin. The BOOK in her bag doubles him over. The other  three laugh, and start to close in. But suddenly  - he finally does. But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and  rushes Edward's side of the car  - he starts to follow the girls. Edward is torn, then abruptly  - he looks at him curiously as she takes a bite. he shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside - - he's surprised. And thrilled. he reaches for the heater dial, he does as well -- their  hands TOUCH. And hold a moment too long. An electric  current connecting them. he goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring  quietly, gravely. Clearly, there's more to this. he sees he needs this, and allows him to put it into her  purse. he closes the curtains, then reaches for the BOOK she bought  earlier. She thumbs through, laying the pepper spray within  reach. everal PICTURES begin loading: the seductive Apotamkin with his  ice-blue skin, devouring his victims in tapestries, engravings,  paintings. Creatures beautiful and horrific. Craven, skeletal  demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring  innocent maidens... it's all murder, blood, sexuality. he walks to him, eyes meeting his... her look says, we have  to talk... and she continues directly past him, into the dark  forest that borders the school. he inhales. She knew, but it's still shocking. We CIRCLE THEM FASTER  - uddenly, he's right next to her. he rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into  - he takes his hand. He reels at the warmth of her touch.  She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is  nearing his lips... then suddenly he's gone. he looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow,  catching his breath. tricken, he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass. he sinks down in front of him. he does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand on  her throat... it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush between them is overwhelming. But Bella doesn't move. he rises, goes to the mirror. Looks at herself, worry  knitting her brow. he takes that in, it's a lot. But it stokes her curiosity. he nods. Understands. He smiles. he notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening. uddenly, EDWARD IS YANKED DOWNWARD! Something has him,  pulling him down.. .  SMASH TO: he shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on.. . he considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of CD's, studying the titles. uddenly, she's airborne as he tackles her and they FLY OFF THE  DECK... then she finds herself  - he does, warily. He grips her more firmly, then LEAPS them to  another tree like a flying squirrel! Then, again, to the TOP of  another tree. He easily gets a foothold, while holding Bella. he does... to the most astonishing bird's eye VIEW of the valley, river, and the mountains beyond. CAMERA whirls around  them allowing us a 360 degree view of their surroundings. Off  Bella's intoxicated face.. . he shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile, as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and slides in. ay Chief, boys want to know, you  find anything down by Queets River  today? he moves off, with a measure of relief. Charlie and Bella  pass each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an  easy rhythm now. he turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside,  straws in their noses, making faces at her. She smiles. he sets it between them. Off them, both reaching for forks.. . he pushes him. He grabs her hand and playfully pulls her  onto the bed, wrestling as  - he nods, bedazzled by him. He takes her face in his hands,  hesitates to test himself, then he softly kisses her.. . he nods, then carefully lies on his chest. He wraps his arms  around her. Off the two of them.. . torm clouds gather in the sky as Bella and Edward pull up in  the Jeep. She takes in a rough baseball diamond, set into an  enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. he'd ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one toward - he SLAMS the door. Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned. he heads down the stairs. Charlie follows.. . he takes a breath, hating herself for what she's about to say.. . ame people, same steak, same berry uddenly, BOOM! - a dark figure LEAPS onto the bed of the  truck. Bella SCREAMS. he catches her breath. It kills him to see her so frightened.  She looks out the window as they drive through town.. . he nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders  his keys to Alice. Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases, pulling out clothes, tossing them to  - he glowers, but picks up the clothes. Dr. Cullen hits the door  opener and the massive METAL DOORS roll open. Dr. Cullen  squeezes Edward's shoulder before he and Esme climb into the SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars  - he hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green,  misty Olympic Peninsula speed past. Off Bella's face - he's taken aback. It's the first time he's engaged with her. uddenly, Alice REELS. Jasper goes to her, Bella follows. he smells like you. Delicious. he slips the pepper spray into her jeans pocket. She wraps  her purse strap around her wrist. She takes a breath,  approaches the school. Peers in the windows. The blinds are  drawn. But from inside, we HEAR a faint sound.. . uddenly, he's right behind her. She freezes. uddenly -- JAMES IS KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME! uddenly Edward's hand SHOOTS UP and GRABS James' ankle. Edward ROARS up to his feet and SWINGS James around like  a  baseball bat, SMASHING him into mirror after mirror. he closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him. ssh. It's alright. I'm not going  anywhere. I'm right here.. . he can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately. They continue into the prom. Several heads turn. Bella sees  - he looks at him... and finally smiles."
3,twilight,EDWARD,", 17. Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair. He seems  inwardly turned, mysterious. More boyish than the others. But  the most striking of all. Bella can't take her eyes off him. -- his back to her, sitting at a front table. But as  she passes Edward's table.. . sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR,  40's. He doesn't see Bella enter.  (to the Administrator) I'll just... endure it. Hello. I didn't have a chance to introduce  myself last week. My name is  Edward Cullen. (prompting) ... You're Bella. Ladies first. Out of town. For personal reasons. May I look? Prophase. Enjoying the rain? It appears. Like I said.  I think I can keep up. Very complex. So you don't like him.  But now you're unhappy.  ... no. It's just the fluorescents. stands by his silver Volvo with his siblings, about to  climb in. A moment as their eyes meet... then he looks toward the  sound of a high pitched SCREECH, that quickly grows LOUDER.. . I was standing right next to you.  You're confused. You hit your head. And what, exactly, was that? No one will believe that. Can't you just thank me and get  over it? You're not going to let it go, are you? (turns, walks away) Then I hope you enjoy disappointment. ... I don't know. ... Bella reaches for him, but he abruptly springs  backward, just out of reach. What's in Jacksonville? You didn't answer my question. Hello. Adrenaline rush. Very common.  Google it. It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet. I know I've been rude, but it's for  the best. Bella, it would be better if we  weren't friends. (snapping, angry) You think I regret saving you? (furious) You don't know anything. No. Our bus is full. (charmed) Edible art.. . I said it would be better if we weren't  friends, not that I didn't want to be. It means if you were smart, you'd  avoid me. Probably not. I'd rather hear your  theories. (levels his gaze, (small smile, considering  it) Which beach? It's just a little crowded. Get in. (through gritted teeth) I should go back and rip their heads off. You don't know the vile, repulsive  things they were thinking. (covering) Not hard to guess. Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We  ran into each other and got talking.  I'm on a special diet. Not exactly. Yes, no. To get to the other side,  and 1 point 772453851. You knew that? I didn't. (stops her, sincerely) Don't go. I feel very protective of you. Yes, I followed you. I tried to  keep my distance...until you needed  help.  I have no idea. I can read every  mind in there, except yours. I tell you I read minds and you think  there's something wrong with you? I... don't have the strength to  stay away from you anymore. (almost to himself) This is wrong. You're cold. We should go. That's my father's car. What's he --  ? Carlisle. What happened? Waylon lived all the way down on  Queets River. 75 miles south. Seventeen. ... A while. Say it. Out loud. Say it. Are you afraid?  You think you know me? Up the mountain. Out of the cloud  bank. You need to see what  I  really am. What I look like in the  harsh light of the sun. Myth. You need to see the truth. Are you afraid? Then come with me. Someplace where  no one can protect you. Where  I  could do what I've wanted to do from  the first moment I met you.  Hold on. Are you afraid! ? , his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some  trees. He watches her cautiously. She takes a step toward  him, but he holds up a hand. She waits. Finally, he takes  a  deep breath, and steps out of the shade  -  This is what I am.  Because you believe the lie. The  camouflage. I'm the world's most  dangerous predator. Everything  about me invites you in - my voice,  my face, even my smell. As if  I  need any of that.. . As if you could outrun me. As if  you could fight me off. I'm designed to kill. I've killed people. I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in  my life. I'm dangerous to you. Don't. You... took me by surprise.  (collecting himself) I don't know how to... do this. Me, and my family, we're different  from others of our kind. We're not  nomadic, we have a permanent home.  We only hunt animals. We've  learned to control our thirst.. . I did. For making me want you so badly.  I'm still not sure I can control myself. I wish I could understand this  thing you see in me. You look at  me with those eyes.. . (devastated) Good.  Be very still. And so the lion fell for the lamb. Sick masochistic lion. Since nineteen-eighteen. That's  when Carlisle found me. In a hospital, dying of Spanish  influenza. My parents had already died. (V.O. ) The word excruciating comes to  mind. But what Carlisle did was  much harder... not many of us have  the restraint to do that. Not just. Our bite contains venom.  And once we taste blood, a sort of.. .  frenzy begins. It's almost  impossible to stop. First with me, then with his wife,  Esme. He found her in a hospital,  as well. The others followed. ... No, that's just Carlisle. He  would never do... this, to someone  who had another choice. Not the only reason. I don't want to be a monster. We call ourselves vegetarians, by  the way... For our kind, hunting  animals is like living on tofu. It  keeps you strong but isn't very  satisfying. It's not that impressive, really.  Anyone in my family can do this. No, that's unique to me. But Alice can  see the future. Her visions are very subjective.  The future can change. Come to my house tomorrow.  A complication. I'll pick you up tomorrow. 'S POV - INT. BLACK CAR Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one  place we never have to hide.  She already ate. (re: Rosalie) Ignore her. I do. I'll give you a tour of the house. A private joke. We matriculate a lot. True, but the younger we start out in  a  new place, the longer we can stay there. ... and this is my room. No sleep. No nightmares, no drool, no  snoring. Do you have any favorites? Ooh, she knows her music. Alright,  nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical. My favorite, too. Ever? (mischievously) I can always make you. You really shouldn't have said that. Trust me? Then close your eyes. Open. The window. As always. What else is there to do at night? Shh! The Chief will hear you! I just... like watching over you. There's something I'd like to try. I'm stronger than I thought. Don't be. But we have to be careful. (serious) I can never lose control with you. Ever. Chief Swan. I wanted to formally  introduce myself. I'm Edward. I won't keep Bella out late  tonight. We're just going to go  play baseball with my family. Yes, sir, that's the plan. (looks him in the eyes) She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise.  It's the American pastime. Plus,  there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the  only time we can play. You'll see why. (to Bella) Put your hair down  - I shouldn't have brought you here.  I'm so sorry. springs in front of Bella, baring his teeth. A truly  menacing, feral SNARL rips from his throat. James GROWLS back. James is a tracker. I saw his mind.  The hunt is his obsession, and my  reaction set him off - - -- We're a large clan of strong fighters  all protecting one vulnerable human. The first place he'll go is your  house. He'll track your scent  there.  Bella, don't do this. Just think  about it, please  - (whispering) I'll be in the truck. He'll forgive you. (off Bella's startled look) Slide over.. . It was the only way he'd let you go. Your father's safe now, Bella. The  tracker is following us  - It's alright. It's just Emmett.  Alice is in the car behind us. But not impossible. We'll tear him up I'll run Bella south, while you lead  the tracker away  - (studies her, torn) Can you keep your thoughts to yourself? Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the  tracker will pick up Bella's scent. We won't, there are five of us, two of  them. When it's done, I'll come get you. You're my life now. I'm coming to get you.  (hates having to say Bella, we're in too deep. We can't  change how we feel.. . In a couple hours. Then you and  I  will go somewhere. Together. The  others will keep hunting. I'm strong enough to kill you. Venom - - No! It doesn't have to be that way. What's the other choice? You said  -  I -- won't be able to stop  - It's alright, Bella. I'll make it  go away. We took care of him. And the  woman, Victoria, she ran off. (darkens) You're in here because of me. The worst of it... was thinking  I  couldn't stop - Bella, you should go to Jacksonville.  Where I can't hurt you anymore.. .   Prom is an important rite of  passage. I don't want you to miss  anything. Shall we? See? You're dancing.  (angry) I won't end your life for you. That's how it's supposed to happen. Her visions change, Bella. Is that what you dream about?  Becoming a monster? You really want this? You're ready right now? You're going to have a long and  happy life with me. Isn't that  enough?"

0,megamind,MASTER MIND,"The real Einstein once said, ""God does not play dice with the world."" He was right, because the world is MY dice. Is that understood? Alright, then - clean slate. Do we have the girl? Reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated. Alright, let's not keep the lady waiting. (O.S.) Miss Ritchi, we meet again. I trust you gentlemen know the very sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe Uberman. And Miss Ritchi, I trust you've already met my new crew: The Mad Geniuses! In a way, I already have. What about my revenge? You have a wicked tongue. I hope you rid yourself of that when you're my queen. Power corrupts absolutely, Miss Ritchi. And when I have ultimate power over this city, I have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it. (annoyed) What is it!? (O.S.) Over here, old friend. (ON MONITOR) Actually, I wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend. (ON MONITOR) Oh, can't I? I have attained control of the Earth's most abundant energy source. I doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED POWER OF THE SUN!!! Excellent. Stop here, I like this view. Any last words? (genuinely concerned) What's going on? What kind of trick is this? Yeah, so? Your weakness is copper? (carefully skeptical) Well...let's not get ahead of ourselves. I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S GONNA RAM US!!! (CONT'D) (horrified) HOLY SHIT! 11. ...so I did. (absentmindedly) Oh, right. (feigning pleasure) Great, great. Put it on the pile. No. Maybe later. (CONT'D) What is it, Plato? When I want your opinion I'll beat it out of you. I have defeated my greatest enemy. I have free reign over Metro City. I have more wealth than a thousand Sultans. I've achieved all I have worked for...so why am I so unhappy? I mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil. (MORE) 23. MASTER MIND(cont'd) And, I have accomplished something he had only dreamed about - the destruction of Metro City's champion. I tell you, I've always lived with this unquenchable thirst. I thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power. But now that I've pretty much accomplished both, I am at a loss. (snippy) Oh, really? He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying, little gnat to him? ...What's the second part? YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD YOU GET SUCH A NOTION? Who the hell is John Cusack? John Cusack, huh? So all I have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS. Please, get a hold of yourself. I've got it! 32. I've got it! It's plain and simple. Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: I must create a new superhero. (ignoring him) Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis! Prepare the subject. (CONT'D) Plato, pour the toxic waste. (CONT'D) Drainage. (CONT'D) Well, Severs? Okay then. And this one? Ah. Does he have extraordinary strength? Can he fly? Resilient to weapons fire? He just breathes under water, then. Plato, the radioactive spider, please. Anything, Stenwick? We're gonna need more venom. (CONT'D) How `bout now, Stenwick? ....Stenwick? This has proven to be a challenge. I just don't know what I want. What do I want? 35. (CONT'D) I want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong. Someone who doesn't seek power - instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion. That's it! Why make a copy when the real thing will do? Then we'll make a new one. Plato, bring me the box! Behold - Uberessence. The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers. 36. Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never got around to following up with that. ...Right. Man, he was good! Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure. (CONT'D) Somebody like him! (into phone) A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. I love it. He volunteers. He doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul. (O.S.) (over radio) Then return to base. We have much work to do. Now, we're sure this won't kill him? Good. Slight electrical shock? Follow him. Welcome to your second birth, Hal Stewart. (CONT'D) Instruction is very important in the formative years. Every hero needs a mentor, a father figure to look up to. (reading paper) Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't believe it. He misspelled his name. (CONT'D) No matter, I suppose. (CONT'D) We've now fully established Titan as Metro City's hero. They will love him just as they loved Uberman. Everything is going according to plan. You know, Einstein, maybe I should have called you Socrates. He also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself. To what? The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth, like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over. You dare? What - did - you - call me? THAT is none of your business, knave! Silence! I'm warning you, Einstein. I said silence! (CONT'D) Get out of my sight. 62. (CONT'D) Oh, no. Don't look at me. You're not gonna get all freaky about this, are you? I only did this because I wanted to talk to you on the same level. You know, without all the baggage? You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about. (CONT'D) Roxanne! What? (mumbling to himself) Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato, it's his fault. He's the one who sent me on this weak-willed path. I'll filet his scrotum for this. Me, a creature of evil, in love with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous. I hardly give such matters thought I should just go up there and just lay it all out to her. ""Roxanne, I like you - I always have. Oh, and I'm sorry I blew up your ex. (realizing the absurdity of his words) Yeah, that would go over like a pants-less clown at a child's birthday party. What the hell am I even doing here? Who cares what she thinks? I'm a supervillain and here I am acting like a love struck schoolboy. Forget this. I control my own destiny! 66. (CONT'D) (disgusted) Perfect. Hello, Triple A? 67. I'll call you back. (O.S.) The lady said no. No, it's a goo gun. It goos. (CONT'D) It's...a prototype. Don't - EVER - say that again. Don't flatter yourself. My, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves. No. (overly calm) Fine, why do you ask? Go on. Just with business, my minion. Just with business. I've decided it is time. Yes, we've created our hero, now it's time to give him a little motivation. To be simply good is not enough. A hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected. Yes, he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure. Gentlemen, it's time for Operation Mentor Kill! Alright, people, we don't have much time. Titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out. (CONT'D) How's the death ray coming? Hum. Let's turn it down a few notches. It's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we? (CONT'D) Anything on the radar yet? I see. Well, he must be planning something big. Are the flame androids deployed? Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da Vinci, take your places next to me. (CONT'D) No slouching. He'll be here. That's the way it works. (CONT'D) Unprofessional, that's what this is. No, it's disrespect for the craft. (CONT'D) Would Uberman have kept us waiting like this? Of course not. He was a pro who knew the score. It's time we spelled out a few things for this Titan. I will not be made a fool of. Do you know who I am? 75. Oh, so NOW you want to get down to it. Well, I want to get a few things off my chest first. (CONT'D) Of all the inconsiderate - Do you have any idea how long we waited for you? We're you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge? (interrupting) -You got to thinking? There's nothing to think about. I'm the villain. I do something bad, you come and get me. Maybe you're right. What's the point? (CONT'D) What are these? (baffled) Where did you get all this? From where? Well, what about your mentor? You want to team-up? 77. What do I think? (CONT'D) I think you're probably the biggest idiot I've ever met. I mean, I can't believe you. All your gifts, all your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment. You know what? Your kind of people make me sick. Oh - gee - I am so sorry! 78. (CONT'D) (under his breath) Of all the people to pick, it had to be this loser. I wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? (O.S.) It hurts. It! I just made myself redundant, old friend. Well, there's no use crying about it now, we must take action. I'm not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon. We must destroy Tighten. 82. Yes, but he possesses the same flaws present in Uberman's DNA - copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin always said: ""If something works don't dick with it."" (O.S.) Your time has come to an end, Titan! There can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's me. I have a better idea - NOW! (CONT'D) That's copper my good man. Your one weakness. (MORE) 84. MASTER MIND(cont'd) For all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect. He's not as dumb as I thought. What's funny? Wow, I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college. So it is. 86. Well, then I wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find. I need your help. You're not going to like what I'm about to tell you. Tell me about it. Well, the evil thing he did by himself. My goal was to give MYSELF purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner. And they call me Master Mind. In hindsight... (almost ashamed) I had some left over from something. I infused him with it. Yeah, that's why I decided to tie you up. He seemed nice. 88. Yeah, good to know - NOW! It's a modest profession! My lair is in the direct path of the ball. You don't understand. I have certain equipment that's - that's highly unstable. I sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay? It's experimental - only one in the world...Well, how do you think I power all my inventions? Someone like me can't pay for electricity. The bills would be outrageous. It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one...If destroyed it could... (proudly) Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard, actually. That little baby is amazing. I'm quite proud of it. (MORE) 91. MASTER MIND(cont'd) (off her deadpan reaction) I mean...we'd better find a way to stop him. Did Uberman have a hideout? A cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. C'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. Roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance. Whose house? Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist? But he disappeared - ""Metro City doomed."" You know, I never thought I'd say something like this, but here it goes - (CONT'D) Not if I have anything to say about it. Such a dark place for one such as you. I wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice? Good lord, man. You've only been dead for two months. (CONT'D) A disguise so simple, it's ingenious. No wonder I never caught on. (CONT'D) Two lives, yet in both you were an ideal. Perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end, old friend. (CONT'D) I'll miss how predictable you were. (CONT'D) Hello? Anyone here...besides..all the BIG MEN who are with me now? (CONT'D) (to himself) What's the worst you're gonna find? (MORE) 94. MASTER MIND(cont'd) The man was a boy scout, not a serial killer. Ahhhhhh! I might just ask you the same question. I had thought I incinerated you. Roxanne told me. As for your ruse, I forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently. Figured if they could do it, so could you. But one thing I couldn't figure out - A few months? How long had you been planning this? I see it all so clearly now. (CONT'D - V.O.) You must have done it just seconds before the observatory exploded. 96. (CONT'D - V.O.) You bore out from under the cage. Then, using your Uber-Speed, - (CONT'D - V.O.) - you made your way to safety, where you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere. (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D) Then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion, then... But why fake your death? Why go through all of it? You could have just quit. And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to disappear? I just can't believe it. This whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart? There's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean, your city. You're really going to do nothing? You're the only one who can stop him. A plane? Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap. I got lucky. (suddenly confused) What do you mean? Game? - Was that all this ever was to you? You know, I was trying my best every time I fought you. Those `outs' as you call them were unintentional. I guess I was never really a match for you, was I? (CONT'D) (thoughtfully) Then how can I expect to be one for Titan? (CONT'D) What about Roxanne? I guess I wasn't the villain I thought I was, and you...you weren't the hero I thought you were. Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible. I told you, Titan is too powerful. If he's set on destroying us, there's precious little we could do about it. To another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight. We'll start over, we'll go back to doing what we do best. Plato, do you have a better plan?! (CONT'D) Hello...Roxanne? Right now I'm packing, later I'll have a snack on the train. In a word - yes. I didn't create this - the god's of irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve. I'll make the time. (CONT'D) You can leave with us. You'll be safe. Will you listen to me, no one can stop him. I'm afraid you have an inflated opinion of me. What? Sweet words, but that man is dead. Please, Roxanne, just come with me. Roxanne? Roxanne? Dad, it's me... (he looks around to make sure no one can hear) ...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked in a while, and I'm sorry. It's been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy. Anyway...You raised me to be the worst that I could possibly be. And I've tried to live up to that as best as I could - even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. But I'm about to do something now that would really piss you off. I'm going to go against everything you ever taught me. I hope...I hope that maybe you'll look down at what I'm about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. If you could do that, then maybe - in your own little way - you could - for probably the first time - find a reason to be proud of me. Well...either way, you're probably going to see me real soon. (calling over his shoulder) Men? Stop packing. Our work is not finished here. C'mon, slow down C'mon. Gutterball! Bowling? What other trailer park sports can you play? 112.  Shit! Stupid monkeys and their fruit. Could it really be that easy-- (CONT'D) Didn't think so. I'm alive. Uberman? 114. I thought. For what? WAIT!!! Quick joke - What's the capital of Thailand? It's bang cock! So, I guess pennies are good for something. 116. They're cheering for me. It's a...it's nice, you know? I usually don't get a lot of feedback. (whispering) But I also kind of caused all this. What happens when they find that out I was the cause of some of this? I guess that is all in the past. I don't think I'd go that far...I mean I just...er... Yes? Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit. (CONT'D) We're okay, right? (O.S) I don't think it would go with your outfit. I'm gonna give you a chance to surrender. Way to take out those two goons, guys! (apologetically) Sorry, we're new at this."
1,megamind,T,"he images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored glove. he inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have an obvious function FLASH and HUM. he chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master Mind. he boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the observatory. otally unfazed, our hero stares on. 7. he panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the burning star's power. he front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power. he satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth. he beam hits the observatory. The building instantly EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire. he blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window. Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out. he figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet. wo beat officers see them and take chase after them around the corner and into an alley. he robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the driver's wheel. hey smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done. hree large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with bricks of CASH. 13. he DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in the three trucks. he tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the city. his bit of news hits Hal like a freight train. his harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned. he massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the heart of Metro City. he cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle of a busy news day. he elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi. 17. he back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News. here's a sudden awkward silence from Frank. here's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if she's failed to convince even herself of this. he building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET LAIR. 21. he waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice. he waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away. he waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS WRIST. he young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby. he crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to fix the problem. he operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL. he woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing her and her baby. She screams. he reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND. ears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and kisses it. he reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother. hey're suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his way in between them. he reporters eat this up. he answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time. he lab is slick, white and ultra modern. he slime is sucked out through the floor, leaving a goo- soaked Severs. 33. hrough a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally. he next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass tube not much wider than himself. he lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what they're hearing. he Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance. he boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark sunglasses - he should get an Oscar. he boy stands up and is about to take off. he Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to absolutely melt. he woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take. he bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS. rucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal. he crowd looks up at the Television. he anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40's, amazing mustache), suddenly has a memo passed to him. 41. he tape shows Hal running in slow motion. he tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation, pushing the woman and child out of the way. rucker#1 snatches his medal back. here is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and SPLINTERING. he sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM SMASHING THE TOILET. he heavens are not in the habit of bestowing a gift such as this to just anyone. You are being rewarded for being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in humanity. o train. wo highly attractive female joggers run by. They're clearly impressed with Hal's show of strength. He smiles and mouths a ""hello."" rust me. itan. here is a long line of people snaked around the velvet ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open teller window. itan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light fixture in the ceiling. itan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands. itan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air. itan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo cowering on the floor. itan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his arm. He's suddenly swarmed by a group of television reporters, including Roxanne. itan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no. hey both turn to see Roxanne's reporter rival Brad Helms, Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK. hat's where journalistic responsibility comes in, no? o people who enjoy being with each other. hey go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John Cusack's disguise generator to short. he Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full of cash from the register. he Hoodlum cocks his shotgun. he hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs and blinking lights. he hoodlum starts to laugh. 68. he hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind. he smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL, covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK. hey stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in conflict. his stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful conclusion. itan flies high over and through the city, under bridges, between buildings, etc. He's not really working, just enjoying himself. 71. itan tries to hide his face as he zooms off. itan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN. Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run around in chaos. itan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home. Reporters stand just beyond the police line. itan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms. he cameras begin to pop and flash around them. itan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully over him. The reporters rush over. itan walks up to one of the cameras. here is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall being tinkered with by Da Vinci. hey move to either side of the chair. hey remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no Titan. 74. itan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV. itan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his guest. itan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and shows it to Master Mind. he picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons. A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his chest. itan proudly points to the two figures. itan puts down his drawing. his strikes a cord with Titan. he overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall. 79. itan shoots up into the air. itan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks nostalgic. itan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration from all. he security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK OF CASH. he bank manager comes over to the guard. he guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing at the startled bank manager's feet. itan flies through the window of the building. He emerges seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty. itan steals a little boy's lollipop and gooses his mother. he BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a dirty rag. itan carefully considers this for a moment. itan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of money. itan melodramatically throws up his arms. wo floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan. itan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars, tries to pull them apart but can't. itan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW. itan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops. he buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane. 85. hey look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL from the top of the establishment. he elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the floor unconscious. itan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves for the camera to zoom in on him. itan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the car. he camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING BALL from Kingpin's. itan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again. he doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the manor. he bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN PASSAGE. he passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR. he door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open. he two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain their normal breathing patterns. he pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in Master Mind's head. itan emerges with Brad and Frank. He's holding a BEER CAN and a bag of PORK RINDS. itan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the sound becomes almost deafening. itan turns to Brad and Frank. here's a long pause as no one says anything. itan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks flying into a nearby building. wo of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive guns. itan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each barrel. hey FIRE. he FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings. itan bends down and pick his beet back up. itan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine- gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a nearby car. 102. itan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The bottom of it was blown apart in the blast. itan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his hand. itan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and Frank still hiding behind the building. he old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man. itan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if it were a paper plate at a barbecue. itan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion. he painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very soul. itan suddenly steps into the shot. itan holds up the massive bowling ball, lining up his shot. itan lines up his shot. itan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main street. itan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something we don't. he ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly reduced. he ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side. It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL. itan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the city with Titan in hot pursuit. he critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one off two more jump him. itan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their sight they begin to attack the fruit. itan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with only his head sticking out. 113. itan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND's CHEST. he crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan doesn't emerge. itan. he terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing next to Master Mind. itan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across the street into a parked car. 115. itan flies up in the air. itan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like an old Warner Bros cartoon. he once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching, with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the pain suddenly surging through his member. he crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He's not sure what to make of it. he crowd erupts in a cheer. he channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the title ""Eye on Metro City."" he news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it. he thugs laugh. he thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his arms folded across his chest. hug #1 draws a knife. hug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles. hug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands in the air. he giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it's sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process. he woman looks at Master Mind, horrified. 120."
2,megamind,H,"e watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as people happily go about their day. is serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND coming from his wrist. e looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm. It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter ""U"". e's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE WITH A GIANT GREEN ""M"" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES. e turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with his metal gauntlet. e quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his posture and sucks in his gut. 4. er face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it. e turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT SCREEN. e presses the button. e looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman. is question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind and the others. e presses the button marked ""Tornado Off."" e takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball, following it with his eyes. al focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson administration era derriere. al turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling him. al sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk. e folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a cat-like grin on his face. e quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the building. e suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in his mouth. e sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns toward his door. e walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND'S FATHER. is image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: MASTER MIND! al comes around the corner and heads in her direction. al stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie his shoe. al looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the way and crashes into the woman and stroller. al struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him. e's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display of affection and the small child in-between their embrace. al slowly eases out of the woman's grip. al looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he's captivated by her beauty. e turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear from his cheek. e notices the book she's reading. ey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think remember something from that one - Let's see: ""My head is screaming `I want you and need you' - my heart it keeps reaching to see you and feel you - yet in the end, I'm alone once again."" Wow, I scare even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just really into poetry. Probably because I'm so sensitive and always going to great lengths to express myself. But enough about me. Can I fill you up? ow do you mean? 31. e glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a huge vat dangles precariously. e brushes the spider off. e stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no advice. e gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them. al puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder. al uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the boy's face before sending him on his way. 39. al is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him. e turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back to the TV. A plan of attack is forming. al rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air. al is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as `I'm Holding Out For A Hero' plays on the jukebox. e reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it up in the air for everyone to see. al wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve. al lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering. al walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the emitting smoke from his jacket. al comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights wobble and streak like a hallucination. e shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks worse. al makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a chair. The room begins to swim. is CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him. 43. al jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself out on the coffee table. al lies in the same position we left him last night. e sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst hangover in the world. e pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his mouth. It's empty. e shakes the thought from his mind. al lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants. 44. e stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content look washes over his face. e whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL. e freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window. e aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now, to see the floor give way. e sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the smashed toilet on his pancakes. al turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the stop. e starts running after it. e slaps himself in the face as hard as he can. al spins around to see a car barreling toward him. e goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the sidewalk. al sits up, disheveled and scared. e closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity. e opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him. e turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business. e rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone has returned to a clothed state. 46. e relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's floating a foot off the ground. al's front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master Mind. e walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he notices the giant hole in the floor. e focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a young Ralph Macchio to kick. e presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA. al enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge and takes a long pull from it. al does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands. al passes out again. e hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is as it seems. e lays his head back down. al leaps up to find he's been resting his head on Pat's lap. al backs away and trips over a box. al grabs his jaw. ey, Corky? You listening? al lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets off his chest. al looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch. al is in the air flying in a sitting position. He's weaving back and forth. ey! al looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof of a building down below. al sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight position. e sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air. e can't believe what he's hearing. e quickly recovers his composure. al walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It's not unlike Uberman's except for a giant ""T"" on his chest. (From here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN) e grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa. e just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him. e turns to George. e tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY TRUCK. e throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN FIRST. e grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up. e hands Titan a check. e listens intently as he refills her glass with wine. e reaches across the table and takes her hand. is true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body. e nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak. e rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes. e stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. e turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but gets the same results. e suddenly spots something across the street. e hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the store. e turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her neck. e turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of him blocking his way. e stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization. e storms out of the room. e gets up and opens the door. It's Master Mind. e suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER VALUABLES. 76. e takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were piloting an invisible jet. e follows the bartender's gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY. e looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him. e turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the street. e stops, hovering in place as he looks down below. e throws the diary over his shoulder. e pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to the public for the first time. e walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete shape just off camera. e grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS. We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN FORMATION. e grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words. e slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC. e walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear them off with his metal hand. e begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway. e opens the door to his immediate amazement. e drop his drink and snack to the floor. e then starts walking to the door. e reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face. e turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME. e looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It's nose- mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him. e stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun gets a bead on him. e thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him. 103. e tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream cone. e looks down at her and smiles. e demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air. e looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier? 108. e leans into the camera. er face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable destruction of Metro City. e smiles in anticipation and uses ""body English"" to direct the ball. e quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere's path. e's furious to say the least. e turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left. e's a block away frantically hitting his remote. e turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him. e puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder. e punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold. e elbows the mayor."
3,megamind,ROXANNE,"You didn't need to turn around like that. I can recognize the stench of failure. Looks like a real group of winners. At the risk of sounding cliche', you'll never get away with this. We go through this every time. You kidnap me to get to Uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes whatever lame trap you've come up with, and takes you and your cronies to jail. I propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by YOU letting me go, and ME forgetting this whole thing ever happened? We can say it was wasting everyone's time. I'm sorry. What makes you think I would want to be your queen? Uberman! Uberman? (CONT'D) You killed him! It's...um...It's good to be back. Thanks for everyone's cards and concerns. I really appreciated it - now I'm ready to climb back on the horse. It's okay. Aren't you? Frank, listen. I want to go back to work. I NEED to go back to work. What're you doing? It was a traumatic experience. Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were...close. But what I really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work. I thought you'd be happy to have me back. 19. Yes? In three weeks? (disgusted) Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an idiot. Oh, because they can't use me to get the big story. (defensive) I didn't use him. We were. 20. Very in love. Okay. So, where are they going to move me if Brad has my spot? Bake sales and pet stories. I'll take it. I just wanted to get back to work. I keep trying to tell people it wasn't really like that. Uberman and I - We were kinda having problems. We broke up. Maybe someone who's a little more aware of his faults. Someone a little more sensitive. 25. Well, until he miraculously comes walking into my life, I'm just going to take a little reflection time for myself. Councilman, is it true that your brother-in-law's construction company won the contract for this project? What's it feel like to be a hero? Shit. (stunned) You're...you're. (captivated) ...Yes. (catching herself) I mean, excuse me? Right. I did have a boyfriend - until fairly recently. I'm sorry - this is so surreal! Things were complicated. He was a man married to his work. There was...there was a lot of competition in his line of business. I'm sure you know what that's like. ...The body-builder who used to play The Hulk on TV? Well...one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than I ever did. But enough about my problems. Right, well, he seemed to need him more than he needed me. It was conflict he thrived on. He always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if Master - I mean, this guy were gone. It was like he needed it, like oxygen. What? I'd love that. (V.O.) John? (V.O.) Hi, it's Roxanne. Listen, I...I really enjoyed talking with you the other day. (V.O.) Great. God, I feel really silly, and if you have a lot going on I totally understand. But, I was wondering if you maybe wanted to have lunch. (V.O.) Great. How does the park sound, around noon-ish? (V.O.) Great, see you then. 52. How's your sandwich? Hope you don't think I'm too forward. Some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out. I just find you really easy to talk to. You know, you're not at all like you are in the movies. Yeah. I don't know - You have this strange, refined way of speaking. Anyway, when we were talking the other day I just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that we've known each other for years. You know what? This sandwich is disgusting. (CONT'D) Of course I already ate half of it. I wonder what that says about my character? Thanks, but knowing me, I was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. It might have been okay at first, but I just made it bitter. When I look back, I probably shouldn't of expected so much from him. He was already a giving person. You know, one of those go out and save the world types. I was selfish, I guess. I didn't want to share him with anybody else. They broke the mold. Listen, Brad. We were just in the area. I was just trying to - He's right. Old habit, I guess. (to Brad) We'll get out of your way. Don't get me wrong, I love being a reporter. I don't think I could do anything else. It's the consequences of what we do that I'm having a problem with. It's supposed to. I got someone I cared about killed. If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been involved. Was he an actor? Jail? 63. Was he ever successful? Thanks for this. You know, this is embarrassing, but it's been a long time since I - (CONT'D) I think it's starting to rain. We might want to find a table inside. Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a long time since...well, I've been with someone I...enjoy being with. Oh my God. This...this is too much, even for you. God, I go out with you, tell you my innermost thoughts. Baggage? You burned my boyfriend alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch! Stay away from me. Damn. Please be open. (CONT'D) Thank God. A pack of Lady Strikes, please. I don't think so. Hey! (CONT'D) Are you following me or something? 69. Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you. (CONT'D) What a minute...all that stuff you use to say to me when Uberman was alive - about me being the loyal queen by your side as you rule over Metro City. That wasn't just super villain rhetoric, was it? You actually meant it! (coldly) Do you really think I would be with someone like you? That's my diary. It's personal. What do you want? So you knock me out and tie me to a chair? He's really out of control. I should have known. You have something to do with this, don't you? - With Titan turning evil. 87. (confused) You're talking like you made him. Let me get this straight. You missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass. That's pathetic. And his powers, they're just like Uberman's. Why would he have his powers? YOU DID WHAT!? You did all this because you wanted purpose? Hal Stewart. He's the guy we thought saved that woman and kid. Turned out he was just trying to save his own ass. You picked a bowler to give super powers to? My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy the whole business triangle. 90. What? Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want anything to happen to your hideout, would we? What do you mean? A HYDROGEN reactor? A REACTOR? - Vaporize the entire city! What? It's under his house. Wayne Scott's. (interrupting) He disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him. Not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous man. (CONT'D) Looks like you got what you always wanted. Uberman is out of the picture and Metro City is doomed. Long enough. (CONT'D) Don't you have something else you can go do? What are you going to do about Tighten? You're running away? You created this monster... There's no time for self pity. 105. I'm not going anywhere. You have to try. The city needs your help. What the hell's happened to you? The Master Mind I knew would never have run from a fight even though he knew deep in his heart that he didn't have a chance in hell of winning it. It was your best quality. You need to be that man right now...I... (heart felt) I believe in you. No...I guess you are a coward after all. (whispering) The guy can outrun bullets. I don't think either one of us is in that kind of shape. I'm here with the cause of the destruction in Metro City. He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall ""Asskickiness."" He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown Metro City as his pins. Annals. Nevermind. Hal, I know everyone treated you like shit, but you don't have to do this.  111. Pretty strange, huh? You saved them. You saved everybody. How's it feel? What they don't know won't hurt them. You're the hero. Master Mind? 117. Stop talking. What is a hero? Well, there are many different kinds. There are those who hear a call, like the policeman or doctor, then there's the kind the public creates in their search for meaning and hope. Then, there are those who have the courage to change."
4,megamind,M,"aster Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS. aster Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat. aster Mind unleashes a wicked laugh. aster Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer terminal. achines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see the observatory shrinking in the distance. aster Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero intently searches his hideout. aster Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED BUTTON on it. aster Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and puts down the control box. aster Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored. aster Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused. aster Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness. aster Mind and the minions all cringe in unison. aster Mind begins to laugh. aster Mind turns toward the window. aster Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with his hands. aster Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward the tornado. aster Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and aims it at approaching windstorm of death. aster Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out of it. aster Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic beat... aster Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat. aster storms in the office to find Plato and Einstein playing darts with the original Mona Lisa. aster Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and Einstein. aster Mind looks into the pit. aster Mind rolls his eyes and walks away. aster Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato. aster Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in the background. aster Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand. aster Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small table. aster Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with white lettering that reads: ""Hal Stewart - Metro City's Newest Hero?"" aster Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console as he speaks to Plato. aster Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal cutting through a dark alley. aster Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal. 42. aster Mind turns to Da Vinci. aster Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look over a ""KARATE KID"" POSTER on Hal's living room wall. eanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering around the crowd to get closer to Titan. aster Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads ""Metro's New Hero: Tighten."" aster Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace around the room with his arms folded behind his back. aster Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over, standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen. 60. aster Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the floor. y point is he took the good with the bad. He grew a little each time. Improved, learned. aster Mind now sits in his true blue form. aster Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food. aster Mind is lying on his back, wide awake. aster Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street from Roxanne's apartment aster Mind is talking on his cell phone. aster Mind stares in shock. aster Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store in a cloud of SMOKE. aster Mind starts to walk out when he's suddenly confronted by the shopkeeper. aster Mind points the goo gun at him. aster Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder like he's a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly behind him. aster Mind turns around. aster Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind him as Plato notices his master's agitated state. aster Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet causing Plato's eyes to bulge in pain. 70. aster Mind tightens his grip. aster Mind releases him. aster Mind did this, you must avenge me. aster Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy. 73. aster Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on his throne. aster Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet impatiently on the armrest. aster Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth. uch to his annoyance, there's a KNOCK at the door. aster Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal fingers. aster Mind throws up his hands. aster Mind shakes his head tiredly. aster Mind looks to Heaven in disgust. aster Mind gets right in his face. aster Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan disappear into the distance. aster Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da Vinci. aster Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded. aster Mind seems to be contemplating something - something bad. aster Mind thinks a moment. aster Mind shoots up out of his chair. aster Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds. aster Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe. aster Mind enters. aster Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his fallen foe. 93. aster Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a gigantic BOOKCASE. aster Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he hears a loud CLICK. aster Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with stone walls. aster Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the door. aster Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen. aster Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery. aster Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes. aster Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the observatory explodes. aster Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted. aster Mind seems deflated. aster Mind's steel hand clinches into a fist at his side. Wayne's oblivious to this. aster Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in silence. eanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks begin to surround them. aster Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb. aster Mind's cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his men and answers it. aster Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches himself before the words swell his heart. aster Mind can hears Titan's familiar laugh from his side of the line. aster Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of his father. aster Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to empty. aster Mind gives him a mocking grin. aster Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT. Titan's EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high pressure stream of water. aster Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of CEMENT mix into the truck. aster Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck cautiously. aster Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING EYES. aster Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him. aster Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a daze, unable to move. aster Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands. aster Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE. aster Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to well up a little. aster Mind throws a hand signal up in the air. aster Mind looks up and waves."
5,megamind,TITAN,"What's the ""T"" stand for? What's that supposed to mean? I don't think this mask is big enough. Are you sure no one is gonna recognize me? 55. Well, boys, there's no need for all this just to get the free toaster. Justice. Now it's my turn. (CONT'D) Hey, George, here comes the sun. (CONT'D) Say, Paul, your mother should know...that you're a scumbag. (CONT'D) John, all you need is love... (CONT'D) ...and a good urologist. 57. (reading) Ten thousand dollars! (CONT'D) (unenthusiastically) I...can't except this. Law and order is it's own...um...reward. It's a message to all the scum out there. Uberman may be gone, but Metro City has a new protector, and his name is ""Tighten!"" Man, what the hell happened down there? Wait a sec - (CONT'D) THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!! Crap. (CONT'D) PAT! (CONT'D) You okay? What's that? Master Mind? Why? This injustice will not go unpunished. Master Mind, if you can hear me, Tighten is coming for you. Oh, for crying out loud. Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah! You're actually the guy I want to see! Well, at first I was going to. You know, because that's what I figured I was supposed to do. But then I got to thinking- - I got to thinking...what's the point? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. (proudly) Get this: I stole them. From all over. You see, once you killed Pat and ruined my other apartment building I was pretty pissed off, so I figured I'd go, find you and kick some ass. Then I thought to myself: ""Okay,then what?"" I mean, if we were to fight, what would I get out of it? Would I get my apartment back? Would I be able to pay the bills? Tell you the truth? He was kind of a dick. I mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but it's volunteer work. Now you've always had the right take on all this. I mean, when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it. I mean, when you don't get caught, which, no offense, isn't very often. And that brings me to what I wanted to propose to you: Who could catch you if I'm by your side? You got the brains, I got the brawn. We could even call ourselves that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at this. (CONT'D) I even designed us some new costumes. (CONT'D) See, you'd be brain, so you got a little one on your costume, and then I'll have brawn on mine...once I figure out the best, you know, visual interpretation of it. What do you think? I worked hard on this. Now, hold on. You're going a little too far. Hey, I mean it. I don't need you, I don't need anybody. I have the power to do and take anything I want. And now, I'm gonna take back everything this city owes me. Beware Metro City, it's time for Titan to collect. (CONT'D) Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY THE WAY I WANT TO FLY! Morning. Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just here to make a withdrawal. I can have anything I want. I'm like a god. Point to any woman in this bar. I could have her in a second. (to Old Barfly) Hey, you wanna get with this? What do you want? That's the question, isn't it. I mean, what do you want when you can have everything? (MORE) 83. TITAN(cont'd) I suppose what I really want is to never be forgotten again. I want to do something that can never be cast aside or one-upped. I want a - what's it called? - A legacy. I want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I like the sound that. Oh. What? Really? (CONT'D) I guess I should leave town then, huh? You know what? You're nothing but a bug. Not even worth my effort. Closer. I want to show the people my real face. (CONT'D) Recognize me? That's right, I'm really Hal Stewart. Former hero and bowling teacher at Kingpin's Bowling. With my new found power, I've recently started to wonder what sort of legacy I should leave. Should I be a hero? I tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed. I was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me - Okay, so what if I didn't ""purposely"" save them! Well, I'm going to make something that can't be taken away from me. I'm going to create a permanent monument to my greatness. One that won't be so easily forgotten or erased. I intend to create a new category in the Guinness Book of World's Records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling. My thanks to the city planning commission. This wouldn't have been possible without them. Tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow. Alright, I want this whole thing to look ESPN professional, understand? (CONT'D) You guys are about to get some good footage. I might need a little room, though. (to beer) Miss me? (CONT'D) Didn't mean to get you involved in all of this. (CONT'D) Hey, man! You killed my suds! (CONT'D) That's one was for you, beer. Guys, please tell me you got that last bit. You're kidding me. I give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing? Looks like I've given the story of the century to the wrong man. Wait. What about that other reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs. Where can I find her. You've been very helpful. Man, have I got a story for you. What pose would be best? The corny folded arms thing? Or maybe on the hips, like this. No, makes me look like a flamer pirate. She's right, Frank. 107. Also got super hearing. I promise not to keep the both of you long, but you'll thank me when this is all over. And I'm going for the biggest strike ever. And you, Metro City, have a ringside seat as I cement my name in the anal of history. What? (in quiet professional bowler announcer voice) Like Tiger before him, a young savior has come to raise a sport from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart, a young man with a dream, realizing that dream here today, folks. (MORE) 110. TITAN(cont'd) One might click there heels and say ""There's no place like home"" upon finding themselves in such a fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much at home right were he is - with a ball in hand and glory in his sights. You're right. I don't HAVE to do anything. Isn't that cool? Here's one for the record books!  (CONT'D) What the...?  YOU! You are becoming a real pain in my ass. I should have done this a long time ago. What the hell? (CONT'D) GODAMNIT! (CONT'D) No more games. If you don't mind, I'm going to punch trough your face now. Oh...Did I interrupt something? Where you going, buddy? (CONT'D) Welcome to Paintown. Population: you. (CONT'D) Time to finish this. What? Huh - I don't know. (CONT'D) Ow."

Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness and loss of appetite. Really? Let's see. There might be epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness... Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer. (to Dr. Woodruff) I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second? Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone. (into the phone) Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking. (listening) Oh, hey. (listening) Nothing important. I can talk. What's up? Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office. Intercut: (into the phone) Fuck that shit! We had plans! Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words. Oh come on! When has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work? Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt. Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin. No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter of the finest herb in New York City, and I'm not smoking it alone. (to Dr. Woodruff) Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration, and sometimes even shock. No.    I'd actually be pretty surprised. Dr. Woodruff is flustered.   He doesn't know how to react. Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad will keep paying for my apartment. I'm not really planning on going to med school. Well, I'm not an idiot. Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words. Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr. Woodruff's desk. He picks it up. Wow!    Is this your daughter? A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's hands. (O.C.) Yeah, I'm in here! Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar is not in the room, however. (O.C.) In here... Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA furnishings), where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a ""clipping sound"" coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked and appalled. Harold walks inside... I'm trimming my pubes. Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple more snips. On the floor, we see LARGE CLUMPS OF HAIR. The mirror's in here. (re: his crotch) Hey, check it out! It looks like a Bonsai tree! Chill out. It makes my Johnson look bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll end up with pubes like my dad. You've seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right? HAROLD notices something... Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months. (calling out to Harold) So what the hell is your problem, anyway? I assume you gave him the appropriate ""go fuck yourself."" Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say ""no"" once in a while. Now lets get high. Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to get that shit done later. Come on, let's smoke a couple joints. Harold thinks for a moment and then caves... One and a half. Now let's do this... Kumar exits the room... HAROLD hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see organized in rows of suits and button downs. So what? It's not like there's a shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor. Just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean I have to. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna smoke this fat blunt, get ridiculously high, and then get something to eat. I think we've already seen this one. Harold changes the channel... I love that shit! Harold continues flipping channels... And the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to... Hey look!   It's you! Kumar points to the TV where we see a CLIP FROM SIXTEEN CANDLES--[Long Duk Dong talking about quiche/round pie] Kumar laughs.   Harold isn't amused. We see another CLIP [Long Duk talking about the chores he does for the grandparents]. Hey, when are you gonna start doing some chores around here? Harold gives Kumar a ""don't even joke"" look. He then violently grabs the bong from Kumar and lights it. Kumar laughs as Harold exhales a lot of smoke... We're not low. No shit!    Let's eat! HAROLD bends down and picks up A BUNCH OF DELIVERY MENUS that have been left on the floor... Nah, I don't feel like delivery tonight. Nah, we've been there too many times. (beat) I want something we haven't had in awhile. Something different. Something that'll really hit the spot. I want the perfect food... I'm telling you, there's one right around the corner from that multiplex in New Brunswick. They walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment. On the side of the doorway is a MEZUZAH IN THE SHAPE OF A NAKED WOMAN. Harold and Kumar walk in without knocking... Rosenberg, Goldstein-- get up.    We're going to White Castle. Rosenberg and Goldstein continue staring at the TV... No waiting.   We're starving... Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing a piece of beef jerky from Rosenberg & Goldstein's coffee table. (scolding Harold) ...Put that down! We're not eating `til we get to White Castle. Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as soon, as Kumar turns his attention back to Rosenberg and Goldstein, he slips it his pocket. (to Rosenberg and Goldstein) Now come on guys, let's go. What the hell are you bringing that for? Harold hands Kumar his keys. Shit, I forgot my cell phone. (thinks for a moment) Nah, we've gone too far. Reveal that the guys are less than 20 feet from their door. ""Bing!"" The elevator door opens and the guys enter. Hey, there's your girlfriend. You actually gonna talk to her this time? What the hell are you doing? That was a perfect opportunity! You could have asked her if she wanted to go to White Castle. Harold doesn't say anything.   He looks down in shame. You're worthless. Dude, it's only awkward because you're a pussy. Just talk to her once and I promise you it won't be weird anymore... Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier. One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight. So what? She's fucking cute.     Let her touch your penis. They exit the front door of the building... Dude, forget about those pricks.    Let's just go. They continue walking... (getting frustrated) Jesus, that took forever. You know the purpose of a car is to avoid walking. (beat) And what kind of parking job is this? You're like a mile away from the curb. (laughing) Just fucking with you.   Now let's go out and get those burgers.   I'm fucking starving! They get in the car and slam the door. The engine starts and the car takes off, revealing that they were parked next to a Hey, Rold-- do you think C3PO is gay? pulls up to an EXACT CHANGE TOLL BOOTH. Dude, give me thirty-five cents. HAROLD sorts through some change in his hand and gives Kumar the money. KUMAR tosses the change into the basket and waits for the TOLL BOOTH STOPLIGHT to turn green. It doesn't. What's going on? It didn't register. (beat) Dude, give me thirty-five more cents. Should I just go through? I can see that. A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a number of cars lining up behind them. Right behind them, A BIG BURLY GUY leans his head out of a car... (to Harold) I'm going through. What the fuck is wrong with you?! No they're not! What? That was the last of our weed. Now we're in Newark of all places.    You know we're gonna get shot. We have to if we want to get out of here. Kumar points to a sign indicating that the HIGHWAY is ahead. Come on. How do you know they're not peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys? With that, the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN OF ALL TIME ROARS AS HE COMPLETES A MONSTER DUNK. In celebration, he violently bumps chests with his teammates. Why? Are cars not allowed to go through when a game's going on? When we were kids, we used to move to the side when we were playing in the street. The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down. I'm going through. KUMAR begins inching forward. Look.    They're moving.   I told you. Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar, they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all times. Harold is scared shitless. He then notices the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN holding the basketball. How do you know? Oh fuck. KUMAR puts the pedal to the metal and ZOOMS AWAY FROM THEM. sees a HIGHWAY SIGN-- ""NEW BRUNSWICK-- NEXT EXIT."" Rold, check it out!      We're almost there! Well, prepare to gorge yourself. I'll see your twenty and raise you five orders of fries. Don't worry, we'll find it. HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead... That means the White Castle should be just around the corner... We gotta get to the bottom of this! drives right up to the PICK UP WINDOW, where we see a chubby BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE... What happened to the White Castle? There used to be a White Castle right in this spot. Where is it? Please tell me there's another White Castle in town. Shit.   What are we gonna do? Do you really think that'll satisfy us? The BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE senses their desperation. (to Harold) I can make the trip if you're willing to. Forget about the med school interview. It's a non-issue. (enticing Harold) You can always do your work in the car. HAROLD thinks for a moment, then licks his lips. Then it's settled. No matter what, we're not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs. Agreed? KUMAR puts his hand out.   HAROLD shakes it. is driving with determination in his eyes. White Castle, here we come. I just wish we had some more pot. I'm almost completely sober right now. HAROLD ignores this. He's TYPING FEVERISHLY ON HIS LAPTOP-- trying to get his work done. Meanwhile, Kumar notices a sign on for the PRINCETON EXIT. Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here. Kumar takes the exit. We're gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into finding us some weed. Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the phone all the time. A twinkie? Look you twinkie bitch, you threw our weed out the window, so now it's your duty to make sure we're high as shit by the time we're eating those burgers. As long as she buzzes us into a dorm, we're set. Give me ten minutes in there and I guarantee I'll find some hizzy. is standing in the hallway, accosting random students. He sees one RANDOM STUDENT walk by... Hey! You know where I can get some chronic? The RANDOM STUDENT doesn't respond. Kumar is frustrated... What kind of Ivy League school is this? Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime of your finest herb. The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A GIANT PLASTIC BAG FILLED WITH WEED. He's awestruck... Oh my dear sweet lord... Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his hand away... Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops, bro! The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar. Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are you? Please. Like they want to go listen to a bunch of Phish records while you read your lame ass poetry. 109.   Got it. I'll see you later. Rold! Rold! You gotta come quick! There are these two filthy pussies who are just aching to get boned by us. KUMAR notices that CINDY is appalled by his choice of words. Uh...I mean...there are two very lovely, young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and I. That's bullshit. He's coming with me. Isn't that right, Rold? CINDY gives HAROLD an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her. Fuck that! KUMAR notices an open dorm room nearby. He enters the room, and returns a few moments later dragging an ASIAN FRESHMAN in his pajamas. He pushes the Asian Freshman over to Cindy... Here-- this is Harold's understudy.     You can do whatever you want with him. (to Harold) Let's go. KUMAR grabs HAROLD by the arm and drags him away. CINDY looks pissed as she watches HAROLD being taken away from her. takes the first puff of a joint. I can't believe you were gonna ditch me for the Joy Luck Club. You know what their parties are like. Just say ""no""! That's all it takes.      Now take a hit of this. Kumar hands Harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens and a SECURITY GUARD enters the hall. He sees HAROLD and KUMAR with drugs. Quick.    In here. The guys rush into the WOMEN'S BATHROOM. Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for us in the women's bathroom. Harold and Kumar hear TWO FEMALE VOICES outside the bathroom. Shit!    Get in that stall! There's a line of THREE BATHROOM STALLS on one wall. HAROLD RUNS INTO STALL NUMBER TWO (the middle one). KUMAR sees the BATHROOM DOOR START TO OPEN. He also runs into STALL NUMBER TWO and shuts the door behind him. The guys struggle to STAND ON THE TOILET BOWL.    Harold's laptop bag keeps smacking Kumar. CHRISTY and CLARISSA (THE TWINS) enter the bathroom.       They're in mid-conversation. Dude, I'm starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party... Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY GUARD from before appears in the hallway with ANOTHER is pissed off as he drives. (using his fingers) I can't believe it. We were this close to getting high and getting laid. Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex with us! And what about Cindy?! She was looking hot tonight! The fact that you're not into her just might make you gay! What?   You'd rather have Maria? From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head. Fine. Suddenly, KUMAR pulls the car over to the side of the road... Daddy needs to urinate. Harold rolls his eyes. gets out of the car (leaving the car door open). He walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen yards until HE FINDS A NICE BUSH. HE UNZIPS HIS PANTS AND STARTS Oh yes!   Yes, that's nice. is still peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY (FROM OUT OF NOWHERE) walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips his pants and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR! Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused. The Creepy Guy simply goes about his business. It's clear that Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple seconds, until he can't take it anymore... Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask you...why are you peeing here? Why did you decide to piss here right next to me? Why not that bush over there? Nobody was here when I chose this bush. I was just saying.... No, I just... (beat) You know what? Forget about it. I'm not in the mood to get stabbed right now. The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package. Thanks. gets into the car and shuts the door.     He hits the gas and continues driving down the dark road... I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But don't worry. Once we get on the highway, we'll be there soon. What's the big deal? Holy shit! HAROLD tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck.     KUMAR tries to help him. How the hell did that get in here? (looking at Harold's neck) Don't worry. He didn't even break your skin. You'll be fine. Ahh! Dude, get that fucking cancer raccoon away from me!!! Thank Christ! Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OF Goldstein? HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief. What the hell are you guys doing here? (to Goldstein/ignoring Harold) Dude-- how were Katie Holmes' tits? Yeah. Nice. (to Goldstein) Well, if you have the yellow fever tonight, there's a rocking Asian party over at Princeton tonight. Dude, you don't have rabies! We're not going to the hospital. Great, let's get out of here. Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT... Shit. turns around and sees HIS FATHER standing next to HIS BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire. 'S FATHER (thick accent) I hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today. Dr. Woodruff is a very good friend of mine, and let's just say he was not at all amused by your antics...and neither am I. Eat my balls, Saikat. 'S FATHER I will not tolerate this business from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one I'm setting up for you. Oh, come on, dad! 'S FATHER ""Daddy will not be coming on anything!"" You will be there and you will behave! I've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up. KUMAR lowers his head.   He's been put in his place. You're right. I'm sorry. KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug.   He even gives SAIKAT a hug. It won't happen again. 'S FATHER Good.   I'll speak with you tomorrow. KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he and SAIKAT walk away. HAROLD is stunned... Fuck that! Like I care what my dad thinks. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I skipped the interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me off? Fine! I don't need his money! I just needed to get my hands on these... KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS. Two words-- medical marijuana. HAROLD shakes his head in disgust. Look, I'm telling you, they see   an Indian and Asian guy wearing these and   they'll just assume we're doctors. Then   we walk right into the pharmacy and get   the weed. Harold does not appear happy he's doing this. We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna get toasted and then we're gonna eat delicious White Castle-- just like we planned. All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE (frazzled, touchy feely). He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry. Leave the talking up to me. On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST. He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain. What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest. HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous. Hold on. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery. We don't have time for questions! We need marijuana now! Get as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it! KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands. (to himself) Shit. Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest. Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous... (disappointed) Very well. I guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way. KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face. Harold gives Kumar a look-- ""What the fuck are you doing?"" (CONT'D) First, we need to clear his C-spine. I want stat x-rays of the chest and abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we need 2 units of O neg on board. Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe what's going on. Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace. Ah, I see. The Patient's got a collapsed lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat! After a couple seconds go by... What's taking so long? (casual) Will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up? A chorus of ""yes, doctors."" (taking off his gloves) Well, it looks like my work here is done. Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous. He then leans down to the BLEEDING PATIENT, who is just barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits... (CONT'D) Say, you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way to get to the White Castle in Cherry Hill from here, do you? (nonchalant) Yeah. It wasn't bad. Hey, check it out!     Your movie's playing. Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater we see: ""JOHN HUGHES RETROSPECTIVE. CURLY SUE - 9:00. And look who went to see it... Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA standing outside, all by herself. He can't believe it. You see? You thought you two had nothing in common. But it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies. Hey, you wanna see if she wants to come with us to White Castle? Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an hour from home. And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. I mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and I was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment I'd tell you ""this is a sign."" Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way... (calling out) Hey Maria! MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN Hey, get your hand off the gas! Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas.   Just then, (looking up) Oh shit! Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us off the road! Fine. KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a ""POP!""   Harold and Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated. Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know how to change a tire. Harold looks in his trunk for the spare.    It's missing. I don't know. Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float? (realizing) Oh shit. That's right. I was with Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day. My bad. I'm Kumar. This is Harold.     Good to meet you, Mr...Freak Show. (whispering to Harold) Eww-- check out those boils on his neck! HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING. (whispering) Oh my God! You gotta look!     One of them's actually pulsating! (whispering) Now there's some sort of puss! It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen! (whispering) Don't worry, he can't hear anything.    Not with all that crust in his ear. HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard a thing. Harold seems relieved. Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife? But he did! It may have been in mid- sentence, but it was still clear as day. They reach the front door and are about to enter... Dude, Liane is fucking hot! Thanks. (beat) So, tell me Liane-- how are things between you and Freak Show presently? Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first? I'm not sure we quite understand... Um, are we talking about one hole or two? (to Harold) Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad. (beat) Shotgun anus! What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow jobs!? No.   You did. We both heard you. Positive. FREAK SHOW ponders this. No problem. Okay, let's agree never to talk about what just happened. searches for some clue of where they are. Dude, I have no idea where we are. All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead. Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up? Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know how to get us back on the highway. Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was my favorite TV show growing up! You were my idol! So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set? Even the chick who played the hot nurse? Well, our night's been pretty crazy too. We've been driving around for hours, trying to get to White Castle, but we keep getting sidetracked. You don't understand, Neil. We've been craving these burgers all night. Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop and get directions. KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET leading up to a gas station in the distance... I don't know. But we can't let him interfere with our quest. Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them. They have to jump out of the way. Cole parks the jeep and exits with (to Harold) He probably can't speak English... Who knew that learning Hindi would actually pay off? The guy says the highway's just down the road. We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes. HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS... (to Cole) Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something. (pissed off at himself) Shit. Cole and the Punks burst out laughing. (to Kumar, embarrassed) Come on, lets get out of here. Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated.   With their leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating. Yeah, I just hate those dicks. (beat) Fuck it. At least now we know where we're going. I'm so friggin' hungry... I think he did. Rold, calm down! I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to know that he'd fuck us over? Where are you going? There's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes. So after you talk to the cops we're still going to White Castle, right? You know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster. The computer responds to the first press. Every press after that is extraneous. This is ridiculous.   Just walk across. Come on, there's not a car in sight! Finally. A ticket?!   Are you serious? Harold motions Kumar to ""shut the fuck up!"" (to Officer Palumbo) Wait. Hold on. Bust my ass?! 220 dollars!? Are you crazy? Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys. (to Officer Palumbo) No, no, no. I understand what's going on. Let me guess. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? You'd pick on guys like us every day. But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, ""How can I still give them shit? I know! I'll become a cop!"" Well, congratulations. Your dream's come true. Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed. Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to Palumbo. (to Officer Palumbo) Hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? Or better yet, arrest him. Lock him up! With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!! (O.C.) (from inside the shaft) Rold? Is that you? (O.C.) Are the cops still there? (O.C.) I called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook park... (O.C.) I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust you out, and we'd get over to White Castle. (O.C.) Hey, fuck you! What did you want me to do? Stand there and take the hit? You know, I've never taken a swing at you before. Never. (O.C.) Look, Rold, I'm sorry. But you're not the only one dealing with shit. My dad's cutting me off, remember? (O.C.) You don't want my help? Fine!    I'm outta here! (O.C.) Uh...Rold?    How do I get out of here? Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief. (O.C.) This isn't good. We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THE Ow...my ass. Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell. You sure you don't want to get out? So what? We'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave. (beat) Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow. Harold thinks about this for a second. Yes! I was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys. Now I get to try all of them to see which one will... What's that smell? Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on Officer Reilly's desk. has his arms around THE BAG OF WEED as he helps it swing the golf club. It's a hole in one! KUMAR TURNS THE is lying on the bed, while THE BAG OF WEED is giving him a massage (yes, the bag has little arms and hands now). (wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxers) is frustrated as he looks at his BILLS. THE BAG OF WEED (wearing a pink bathrobe) comes out of the kitchen holding a MUG OF Hurry up! Hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there. (beat, re: weed) Dude, look at this. It's like we went from being broke to being millionaires. Suddenly, they hear what sounds like A COYOTE'S HOWL. Just a coyote. Don't worry. That's only because they sound scary. In one on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down. (CONT'D) Now cheetahs, they're another story. The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down. Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit. They're not known for eating humans. Okay, I'll admit, that's not a good sign. But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll probably leave us alone. HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins walking directly over to HAROLD... Shhh. Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON (annoyed) I thought I told you not to take that jerky! HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins licking Harold's face in friendship. Dude, I think I have an idea. I'll tell you, but first we have to get really high. Kumar opens the bag of weed. Pan up to the night sky for a time lapse.   We see smoke coming up from below. Pan back down... Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet. It's as good as a car. Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away. Well, we'll soon find out. (like to a snow dog) Mush! Mush! Both! I'm sorry! You've been out cold for the past half-hour! I figured that maybe if I did some gay shit you'd wake up. HAROLD wipes his face with his sleeve. He then gets up-- he sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves. It ran away. But forget about that. I have some bad news and some worse news. I checked out some road signs. The cheetah took us in the wrong direction. Your laptop is completely destroyed. Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag, broken in pieces. It smashed against a tree when you fell off the cheetah. Well, the laptop really only effects you. Whereas the White Castle situation effects both of us equally. Don't worry, dude. Your laptop's insured. Exactly. First, we'll take a cab over to White Castle, then we'll... Come on, Rold! You can get that shit done in a couple hours. We can't quit now! Fine...We'll find a pay phone and get a cab back to your office. Harold, furious and almost in tears, simply nods ""yes."" (pointing) Look, there's a Krispee Kreme.     We'll call from there. Oh great.     Here we go again. COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS are hacky-sacking in the parking lot. Their skateboards are sitting nearby. (to Rold) Fucking asshole. Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and points... What?    A chocolate cream filled? Are you saying what I think you're saying? Yes!    I knew you had it in you! Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table... Is that Cindy Kim? Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein. Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are ""an item."" You should have boned her when you had the chance. Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold. (pissed off, but powerless) Fuck! I'm so sick of their bullshit! Your lead? Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads towards the YELLOW JEEP at a brisk pace. KUMAR follows. What the hell are you doing?! This is your plan? (laughing) Hey, slow down to like 25 mph, so they think they have a chance to catch up. (in thick Indian Accent) Thank you, come again! Harold guns it-- leaving Cole and the Punks in the dust. Victory is sweet! Nice job, Roldy! Wait.   Do you smell that? KUMAR keeps sniffing. He turns around to the back seat. He reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. It's a WHITE CASTLE bag. He pours out the contents and we see EMPTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER CARTONS fall onto Kumar's lap. Those assholes got to have White Castle?! Don't worry . Forget about that. We have a car now. We're back in the game. Pretty soon we'll be eating our own White Castle. Want me to drive? Those guys are fucking posers! Dude, we're almost there! Oh shit! KUMAR turns around and sees the police car behind them. What are you doing?! Buckle up? Kumar buckles his seat belt.   HAROLD MAKES A SHARP TURN... Where the hell are we going?! It's a good thing I have an empty stomach, or else I'd puke right now! (pointing) Rold! Look out there! Not necessarily. KUMAR walks over to the JEEP and points to the HANG-GLIDER... Dude, it's okay. I used to hang-glide with my dad all the time when I was kid. I know how to do it. We did it on our trips   to India. I swear. I know exactly    what I'm doing. I've even done it with   two people at the same time. My brother    and I did it. You think this just about the burgers, huh? Well, let me tell you-- it's about far more than that. KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The scene is very picturesque... Our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very, very hungry. And they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals. A land where their kids could study and get into good colleges. A land filled with hamburger stands. And not just one type of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with different sizes, toppings, and condiments. That land was America. (turning to Rold) You think this is just about the burgers? No. This is about achieving what our parents set out for. This is about the pursuit of happiness. This is about the American dream. KUMAR walks over to HAROLD. And so we've reached this point. The point which all men eventually have to face. The point of no return. (beat) We can stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to White Castle. Or we can take the hang-glider and make our leap towards freedom. I leave the decision up to you. From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are getting closer. Harold turns back, facing Kumar... Grab onto the end of the bars and hold on tight. HAROLD does as he's told. They are both holding onto the bars (Harold behind Kumar). Okay. Here's how this is gonna work. On the count of three, we're gonna run to the edge of the cliff. When I say ""jump,"" launch yourself forward as if you were diving into a pool, got it? Don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine. Are you ready? HAROLD's too nervous to speak.   KUMAR gets into position. Okay, here goes. One...two...three! HAROLD and KUMAR START RUNNING TOWARDS THE CLIFF. Good job, Rold! Keep running! Rold, there's something I gotta tell you. I've never hang-glided before.  Dude, it's working! Hey, how else was I gonna convince you to jump off a cliff? We're not low. They continue gliding though the sky for a while... Yeah? Uh...well...I guess it's just gonna go down at some point. Why do you ask? Oh shit! HAROLD AND KUMAR FLY RIGHT INTO THE CROWS.   Numerous birds collide with their faces... We're gonna die! We're gonna die! We're gonna live! Ha! Ha! We're gonna live! (beat) You see, Rold? That wasn't so bad. Stop...I...can't...breathe... Rold... (pointing) Rold...look! We made it, dude. Same.    Only make mine Diet Cokes. You don't have money?! Shit, I gave all mine to that asshole at Princeton! Fuck that hippie fuck! This can't be happening! We're so close and we're fucking broke! What are you doing here? Do you realize what we had to go through after you stole the car? Dude, we're here. Isn't it great? Hey, look! KUMAR points to a TV in the corner of the restaurant.    On the screen we see A MORNING NEWS SHOW. Wait...let's do it together. It was the best meal of my life. Dude, you know what? I think I may actually go to my interview today. Yeah. You know, my whole life I've been afraid being just another nerdy Indian guy turned doctor. Well, tonight got me thinking... There are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine... HAROLD pretends to be listening to KUMAR-- BUT HE IS MORE FOCUSED ON BILLY AND J.D., who get out of the car with their women and start walking towards the front door. Like having boils all over your face. Or dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through. Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night. Somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick Harris, I realized that I've always wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been too scared to admit it. KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention... Hey, Rold, are you listening to me?   I'm having a major epiphany here. Way to go, Rold! Where the hell did that come from? No shit! I guess you're worthwhile after all. So those dudes have gonorrhea? What's the rush? There's plenty of time before my interview. Good luck, dude. KUMAR stands behind, while HAROLD approaches MARIA'S door. Dude...we gotta go! To Amsterdam! We can pack up right now and take the next plane. Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule it. He won't have a problem, as long as I'm taking it seriously for a change. Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria! For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is the kiss of death. There are gonna be suave, sophisticated guys all over her. By the time she gets back, she may not be available. Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying. Hey, Rold!   Wait! You do realize what's legal in Amsterdam, right?"
1,harold_kumar_white_castle,HAROLD,"(confused) But aren't you supposed to... Uh...okay...no problem... BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk. Fuck. I'm not gonna be able to partake in our usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta stay late at the office. I know, but I gotta get this work done. (O.S.) Listen, I'd love to go home, but... Yes!   Right in front... Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND. The jeep is loaded with ""alternative"" stickers, and has a KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof. Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car. (frustrated, to himself) Those assholes. The driver, COLE (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud mouth), puts down his window... COLE is joined in the jeep with his EXTREME SPORTS PUNK FRIENDS, who all laugh at Harold. Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous. and MARIA are standing silently as the elevator goes up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak... So Maria, what's been going on? My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change. (deadpan) Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And the guy next to me still smells like crap. But a man can dream, right? So what are you up to tonight? (disappointed) Really? (playful) That sounds awful. Harold laughs, as does Maria.    They smile at each other... Well, if you want some company, maybe you could sit on your ass at my place. and MARIA stand silently while the elevator goes up. It's clear Harold wants to say something, but he doesn't have the courage. They reach their floor and exit the elevator. Bye. Kumar? Kumar? Kumar, what the hell are you doing! Why aren't you doing this in your room! I'm gonna puke. Get your clothes on. Are those my scissors? Oh my God!     I trim my nose hair with those!  (O.C.) Other than my roommate's boney ass? (calling out) One of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight. Kumar walks back into Harold's room... If by ""go fuck yourself"" you mean ""no problem sir"" then yes, he got the message loud and clear. KUMAR shakes his head in disgust... No.   I got a lot of work to finish. Kumar shuts Harold's laptop. One joint. Don't you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously? At some point your dad's gonna get really pissed. Well, then what are you going to do? Sounds like a plan. takes the first hit off the blunt. He nods to Kumar, as if to say ""that's good shit."" Kumar takes the blunt from Harold and inhales... Nice.   Sixteen Candles is on. Oh come on. It's a John Hughes movie! It's a classic! It's a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved... We're so high right now. I don't know about you, but I'm hungry as balls. What about KFC? and KUMAR exit their apartment. You're sure you know how to get there?   I haven't been to White Castle in ages. and KUMAR walk into an apartment that looks almost identical to theirs. (Instead of a ""BILLY MADISON"" poster, there's one of ""HAPPY GILMORE."") Is that all you Jews ever think about? Tits? presses the ""down"" button. KUMAR notices that Harold has his LAPTOP BAG on his shoulder... You're driving. I'm gonna try to get some of my work done in the car. Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty. Why don't you just run back and get it? I'm not worthwhile. It doesn't matter. The only girls interested in me are girls I have no interest in. Like Cindy Kim. God, she invites me to everything. Why do I have to be the catcher? Don't even start. Of course he's gay! You remember in the first Star Wars when he was like... (in a gay C3PO voice) ""Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel soooo good!"" Kumar laughs. I don't have anymore change. No.   I don't like breaking the law. Harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on. Just hold on. I'll walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened. The honking continues as HAROLD starts to open the door... Are you crazy? Oh shit, we're dead! Harold throws the joint out the window. (paranoid/looking back) You just tore out of there! The cops are gonna catch us! Take this exit! and KUMAR drive through the dangerous streets of Newark. They're very quiet, until Kumar breaks the silence. Look, I get a little paranoid sometimes. Maybe it's not as bad as they say.    It's probably just a bunch of hype. They look out the window and see another ASIAN and INDIAN guy (Daniel and Shankar) walking down the street. Suddenly, THREE HOODS jump out from an alley and start beating the living shit out of Daniel and Shankar. Kumar gives Harold a dirty look. Let's get the hell out of here. KUMAR continues driving. He makes a turn. All of a sudden, he stops short, causing he and HAROLD to jerk forward quickly. What the... Dude, we are NOT driving through that basketball game! Forget about it. No way. Turn the car around. For some reason, I don't think this is the same thing. Don't! The BASKETBALL PLAYERS slowly begin moving aside. Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us. Look at him! The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN has an ESPECIALLY ANGRY FACE. That was close, dude. Yes!    Thank God! I'm starving! and KUMAR are looking for the White Castle... Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like twenty of those burgers. God, where the hell is this place? There's the multiplex! What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That doesn't look like a White Castle to me! Are you sure? I don't know. Should we just eat here? Kumar, I have a shitload of work to finish. And you have that med school interview in the morning. Let's do it. Agreed. Why? Oh no.    I'm not seeing Cindy. She calls me. Then she rambles on about her East Asian Students club or whatever. You know, yellow on the outside, white on the inside. Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us. No, forget it. I'm not seeing Cindy Kim. is sitting on a bed, next to CINDY KIM (very cute, prim and proper, Korean girl). Sitting on the floor are A DOZEN ASIAN STUDENTS-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy clothes, etc). Harold is kind of creeped out by them. (unenthusiastic) Yeah. Me too. Uh, yeah.    They were...nice. Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to Cindy. ""Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?"" Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while... (to Kenneth) Uh, yes? Yeah, I'm a junior analyst. Yes? What it's like being an investment banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's pretty... HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian students. He can't bear to tell them the truth... ...awesome? All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other. As for the recommendation, I may be able to make a call or two... CINDY looks at her watch... Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait for Kumar... Nice. CINDY grabs HAROLD's hand and drags him away. (to Kumar) Let's go to the party for a little while. Look, what do you want me to say?     I was under pressure. and KUMAR try to decide where to hide. Shit!    What if he finds us? (whispering) Ew...gross. CLARISSA runs into STALL NUMBER ONE and shuts the door. The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to look over at that stall. (whispering) Shit!  Oh, come on, you always exaggerate.    We weren't gonna get laid. I know Cindy's cute, it's just... Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end up with Cindy anyway. It's just more practical. Now can we drop this and get our asses to White Castle? Now what are you doing? Do you even know where you're going? We better.                                                      It starts to rain... Shit, now it's raining. Look, I'm completely on edge right now,                         okay? After all the shit we've been                             through tonight, I don't know how much more of this I can take.  Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have rabies now or something! Oh, that's not good! KUMAR Shit!!!                                Shit!!! KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, breathing heavily. They watch nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins walking over to them. Uh-oh. KUMAR rolls down his window.         The DRIVER peers inside... (feeling his neck) We haven't gotten there yet.   I think I got rabies, though. Will you stop it? I'm feeling very woozy. I may have to go to the hospital. I don't have rabies. Kumar stands up quickly. Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come to the hospital. Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches. Wow. So I guess you're going to med school after all, huh? (extremely confused) But...you just hugged him... and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks) walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway... If we get caught, you're taking the blame. This wasn't my idea. (whispering to Kumar) What the hell's going on here? Oh shit!   This guy's gonna die!!! Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all wrong. We're not doc... KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth. I'm telling you. That was amazing!    Even your dad would've been impressed! This is perfect! We're back on the road. We have directions now. The rain let up.                 And guess what... clicks on the ""SAVE"" option on his laptop... I'm officially done with my work. (beat) I'm telling you, things are finally starting to go our way. While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his surroundings and notices something... Holy shit. No way.    Forget about it.   Just drive. Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his undivided attention. Stop it. Let's just go! KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN. What are you doing?! You asshole! My car's probably all scratched up now! I told you I didn't want to speak to her! (composing himself) Whatever. Let's jut get back on the highway. examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby. There's not another car in site. Godammit. You know how to change a flat? Where's my spare tire? Shit, where the hell is it? Kumar suddenly remembers... What bridge? What the hell are you talking about? Your bad?   What are the hell are we gonna do now?! Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES. Thanks for helping us out. KUMAR Uh...Yeah.                        Sure, he's great. So where exactly are we going? (whispering) Will you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you! KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL. (whispering) What's the matter with you? You think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying? He's two feet away from us. He can hear this entire conversation. He can hear me talking right now. (with laptop in tow) and KUMAR stand by their car, as FREAK SHOW brings out some tools and a new tire from his house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere. He couldn't have said that. Who cares? You've seen Freak Show. What do you think his wife is gonna look like? and KUMAR walk inside and see THE HOTTEST CHICK OF ALL TIME (LIANE) walk out of the kitchen. She is dressed Daisy Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest. Okay. It's official.     We've entered the Twilight Zone. She's not ugly. LIANE comes in with the pitcher of lemonade.    She pours them drinks and hands them the glasses... Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak Show...end up with a woman like yourself? Wait a second-- what about Freak Show...and this whole Christian thing you guys have going on? No, I just... Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window, where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy. Nevermind. (to Kumar, swinging his hand) Okay, rock, paper, scissors... Huh? Sorry, no thank you. Forget it! I don't want our balls rubbing against each other. No way! KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation... Okay, let's do that. Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts. Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold starts to massage her chest. AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a particularly threatening TIRE-IRON... (scared shitless) Uhh...you said outside that we can have sex with her! FREAK SHOW runs over to HAROLD and grabs him by the collar! and KUMAR burst out the front door and run towards their car. They get in and peel out as fast as they can. Agreed. And get chopped to bits?     Are you crazy? Kumar pulls over to the side of the road... Fuck that! It's my car! We're not picking up a hitchhiker! The back door opens and Neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car. (to Neil) Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil Patrick Harris? Hey, you don't know how to get back on the highway, do you? Huh? and KUMAR get out of the car.   NEIL is still in the backseat. The car is still running. We'll be right back, Neil. NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start walking over to the CONVENIENCE STORE. What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why's he so horny? (upset) Oh shit. These idiots. Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them... and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests... Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here? The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders. (to Kumar) Huh?   Oh, good. Somebody should do something. (to Kumar) I didn't mean you should do something. Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face. Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior. It's a tense moment. Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up. Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard, this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling... and KUMAR walk back towards their car... Kumar-- you okay? (calm) Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car?  Why the hell did you leave the keys in the car?! This is all your fault! This whole fucking night! You know I leased that car! They're gonna make me pay for it! Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store. I'm going to call the police!   I don't want to talk to you anymore! Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face. ""Extremes"" all around! I'm not speaking to you. Harold waits for the ""DON'T WALK"" sign to change. It doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE ""WALK"" BUTTON REPEATEDLY. Thank you, Mr. Wizard. HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't change, he begins pressing the button again. Jesus Christ! When are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency? The ""DON'T WALK"" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the left and then to the right. The street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide. It'll change in a second. They stand there for another ten seconds.   It doesn't change. Alright fine. You want me to cross? I'll cross. Just leave me alone! Harold starts walking angrily across the street. Shit! Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as OFFICER PALUMBO (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the car and walks over to them... (looking at cop's name- tag) Good evening. Is there a problem, Officer...Palumbo? Yes. Yes I have. I'm so sorry. I promise I'll never do it again. (stepping in front of Kumar) Let me apologize for my friend. I promise I will pay the fine. But actually, I'm glad you're here. You know the TV show Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie Howser just stole my car and... Kumar, shut up... Harold. Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo. Thank you. OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk away. Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't... Oh shit. (calling out) Hey, are you gonna do something about my car? Hello? Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE ASSHOLE and his MOM. The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check. Can I at least give you my car's licence plate number? Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio... So what are you in here for? Come on.   Seriously. TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation. Holy shit.   What did you do? That fucking blows! Tarik nods and continues reading his book.    Harold sees that Tarik is remarkably relaxed. I don't understand how you're able to be so calm about all this. Assaulting an officer. No. I actually did hit the cop. But only because I was trying to hit my friend. Well, ex-friend. That was strange. Suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a VENTILATION SHAFT on the ceiling, above one of the officer's desks. What the hell was that? (shouting out) Kumar?! What the fuck are you doing?! No, they...   Wait a second, did you... Jesus Christ! What did you do that for?! Forget it! I don't want to get in any more trouble! I'm already in here because of you! Well, I never got your car stolen! Hey asshole, I'm in jail! Don't bitch to me about your problems! Just leave me alone. I don't want your help. How the hell should I know? Jesus Christ. Tarik shakes his head. And become a fugitive? Are you nuts? The guy has all my information. Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report, Harold's I.D., and his laptop. Fine.    Hurry up. Kumar smiles.   He begins searching for a key. Kumar, hurry the fuck up! Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple keys, when he suddenly smells something... Kumar?...Kumar! Kumar can't hear Harold. He's in a trance. We begin to hear a romantic song as Kumar stares lovingly at the BAG OF WEED... What the hell are you... Suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room, pushing a black man wearing pajamas (NATHANIEL BANKS). Nathaniel seems very gentle. He's even wearing a turtleneck sweater. (to Kumar) Wait-- shouldn't we do something about this? and KUMAR (still clinging to the weed) burst out the door and run down the steps. They race through the street and start heading towards a FOREST. and KUMAR have stopped running.   They start catching their breath. Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking mad house! Thanks for getting me out of there, dude. What was that? Aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes? We're gonna die. We're gonna die. (whispering) This isn't working. (eyes closed, screaming) He likes me. Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up... What is it? Has it come to this?    Are we really gonna ride this cheetah? This is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done. HAROLD puts his arms around KUMAR to hold on.    Kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt... Dude, am I just really high or is this is actually working?! This is great! We'll be at White Castle in no... I love you, Maria. MARIA gets up and runs away. HAROLD playfully chases her. Maria runs over to a FRENCH FRY TREE. SHE PLUCKS A COUPLE wakes up to find KUMAR LICKING HIS FACE.   HAROLD JUMPS What the hell are you doing?!!! What happened to the cheetah? (nervous) Tell me the worse news first. That sucks.    What's the bad news?  Why the hell didn't you say that THAT was the ""worse news""? Oh no! No! No! It's not that! All my work was saved in there! Now I gotta go back to the office and re-do everything! Forget White Castle.   There's no time! 'S CAR AIRBORNE AS IT SCALES A HILL!    THE CAR LANDS, Look! Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside, sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down... Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT. HAROLD and KUMAR watch through the window longingly... (yearning) I want that. No.  I want that feeling. (beat) The feeling that comes over a man when he finally gets exactly what he desires. (beat) I NEED that feeling. We gotta go to White Castle. KUMAR gives HAROLD a hug. (to Cole) Hey, why don't you just leave us alone? Nothing. Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee Kreme entrance. Kumar follows. In the background Cole and the Punks are laughing about what a ""pussy"" Harold is. (totally calm) Don't worry. The universe tends to unfold as it should. Kumar gives a ""What the fuck is he talking about?"" look. Besides, I have a plan.   Follow my lead... I'm stealing their car. It's working isn't it? and KUMAR are laughing and slapping five. I had to do something. KUMAR begins sniffing something in the air... This world is so unfair. No. I've got everything under control. We should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done after our feast. Just find us some tunes. A tape is resting in the tape deck.   KUMAR pushes it in... HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other amazed that COLE has some lame chick song on his tape. and KUMAR are still singing... All of a sudden, HAROLD and KUMAR hear a POLICE SIREN. looks determined as he puts the pedal to the metal. I'm not going back to jail!     We've come too far! Now buckle up. Just hold on! Don't worry. We're gonna make it. Everything's gonna be... KUMAR Shit!                               Fuck! Oh shit!   We're trapped! Kumar notices something... No. No way. Not a chance.       I'd rather turn myself in than die. You hang-glided? I don't remember that. No, Kumar. I'm not risking my life over a bunch of hamburgers. KUMAR walks over to HAROLD and stares him in the eye... I hate you, Kumar. Hurry up...they're almost here! (nervous) I think so.  KUMAR Oh my God!    Oh my God!   Oh my God! I can't believe you lied to me! Dude, we're so high right now. Hey, Kumar? How are we gonna get down? That's a great answer. Made me feel really comfortable. Thanks a lot. KUMAR looks down as they fly over a playground. Is it a problem if we fly into birds? Because we're about to! KUMAR looks up and sees at least A HUNDRED CROWS FLYING Ahhhh!   My eyes! Don't peck out my eyes! I hate you!   I hate you so much! (breathing heavily) That's it...I'm gonna kill you... That's the point! You're gonna die! I want thirty slyders. I want five french fries. I want four large Cherry cokes. Hey...hey...hey...where's my money?! Where's my fucking car you prick! Thanks, I guess. NEIL hands them some cash... (concerned) What happened to the car? Where are you going? I know. I can't believe we made it. AND we got the car back! If we can just get out of here in a half hour, I can get back to my office and get the work done. (to Kumar) Hey, good for those black guys! and KUMAR have put three tables together, on which we see SIXTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGERS-- EACH ONE STEAMING HOT. TWO GOOD-LOOKING GUYS (JON and HAYDEN) stare at Harold and           Kumar's orders, amazed by their size. They then look at              their own orders and realize how worthless they are.                 HAROLD and KUMAR are sitting across from one another, looking at the smorgasbord in front of them. HAROLD IS ABOUT TO DIG and KUMAR have finished their meals. They both look full and satisfied. Harold takes one last sip of his soda. Oh...that hit the spot. Mine too. The two of them sit there, looking at all the empty containers and wrappers. After a long pause of silence, KUMAR speaks... Seriously? (not paying attention) Uh-huh. I'll be right back... At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On the other hand, has a sweet RENEE ZELLWEGER quality about her. She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple... (O.S.) What the fuck is going on here? BILLY turns around and sees HAROLD... Never mind me. What are you doing here? I thought you and J.D. were busy all night with ""clients."" Isn't that why I had to do YOUR work? Back off, cock boy! What I have to say to him goes double for you! KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it. Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback. Tell him what? That I'm your work horse! That you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh? J.D. is stunned.   Now he's a little nervous. No, YOU don't understand. I'm not doing your work anymore. And I'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore. TRACI and ZOE hear this and are freaked out.   They slowly back away from BILLY and J.D.... Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get going. See you on Monday. HAROLD leaves the RESTAURANT. KUMAR follows.     Billy and J.D. are left embarrassed and in shock. and KUMAR walk over to Harold's Infiniti... I don't know. Eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man. Now I'm actually looking forward to work this week. I'm not worthless. Beats me. (beat) Now, come on, let's get going. I have some unfinished business to take care of. They both get into the car (Harold gets in the driver's side). The car zooms out... 'S WHITE INFINITI PULLS INTO TO A SPACE RIGHT IN FRONT (lying) Oh...uh...nothing...wrong room. (grossed out/depressed) Look, I really don't need to hear it. I guess I just made a mistake. Sorry for interrupting you guys... Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY. Kumar feels sorry for his friend. Just then, Luis leans his head out the door... Huh? Oh!    Maria's brother! Actually, I'm Kor...wait a second-- she talks about me? A HOT BLACK CHICK (AISHA), wearing only a bra and g-string, walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him... Uh, no thanks. I'd rather do it in person. Huh?   Where? What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? What about your interview with the med school guy? She's coming back in ten days! It's not like I'm never gonna see her again. Forget it.   I'll just wait till she comes back. Harold starts to walk away from Kumar..."

He then puts the laptop along with all his paperwork into a bag and leaves the office. arold walks to the end of the parking lot, where his car is parked. As he walks, the strap of his laptop bag breaks and falls to the ground. Harold is frustrated as he picks it up. arold's driving his WHITE INFINITI G20. He finds a spot... e ends up parking far from the building. He has to parallel park. He's anal with his parking, going in and out a bunch of times, until the car is positioned perfectly in the spot. arold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He walks up the steps to the LOBBY ENTRANCE of his building... Suddenly, he stops in his tracks. Through the glass door, he sees... MARIA-- A beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of Puerto-Rican descent. She's standing by the elevators. HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl. Harold takes a deep breath... arold enters the building and walks over to Maria. They give each other a friendly smile. We hear a ""BING"" sound, indicating the elevator has arrived. The doors open and Harold and Maria walk inside. arold turns on his laptop and is ready to start working. arold (still wearing his button-down shirt, only now untucked) enters the living room. Kumar is now licking the blunt. arold and Kumar are now smoking out of an ENORMOUS BONG, while watching TV. The room is filled with smoke. arold's answer becomes clear as he pushes the ""door closed"" button repeatedly. The door closes before Maria sees them. arold and Kumar exit the elevator... arold and Kumar walk down the steps, where they see COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS doing lame skateboard tricks on the sidewalk near their jeep. They're about to get back in the jeep, when Cole sees Harold and Kumar walking near them. arold and Kumar finally reach Harold's car... arold is meticulously rolling a joint. arold's Infiniti approaches a line of TOLL BOOTHS. arold's Infiniti drives down a street, loaded with mini- malls and fast food joints... arold's Infiniti is back on the highway... ippie Asshole sizes Kumar up and then gives Kumar him a measly dime bag... arold and Kumar run down the dorm hallway, grossed out.    As they run, they suddenly see-- arold and Kumar stop in their tracks when they see the EAST ASIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party in full blast. All the ""nerdy"" asian kids from Cindy's room are grinding with each other as KENNETH RAPS A FILTHY RAP. Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock. Some of the dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot. Kenneth jumps off the couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of POT BROWNIES. arold's car races down a road in the middle of a FOREST. arold enters the room with a band-aid on his neck... arold's car is cruising down some streets lined with stores. arold is very excited. Kumar is proud of himself, but playing it cool. arold's Infiniti is driving down a dusty trail in the woods. arold turns around and walks back towards the street. Kumar walks with him, keeping his distance. They reach the street. On the other side, he sees AN ORANGE ""DON'T WALK"" SIGN LIT UP. Harold presses the ""WALK"" BUTTON on the post next to him. arold steps in front of Kumar and puts his arms up to block him. Palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement towards him. arold takes this all in. arold and Tarik are now left all alone in their cell. arold and Kumar are now sitting on top of the CHEETAH, smoking joints. Kumar has a belt around the cheetah's neck like reigns on a horse. arold and Kumar stand there, speechless, as Neil drives right past them, splashing a puddle in Harold's face! They stand there, watching silently as NEIL drives off. Harold is now drenched. Muddy water drips from his hair and clothing. He gives Kumar a dirty look. Kumar knows he shouldn't push Harold any further. arold and Kumar walk over to the parking lot. Unfortunately, they notice a familiar YELLOW JEEP COVERED IN STICKERS. arold is shifting gears... arold drives the car out of the parking lot.   Cole and the Punks give chase on their skateboards. arold drives COLE'S JEEP down at a speed just slow enough for COLE and the PUNKS to think that they have a chance... arold and Kumar are now listening to another lame chick song. While they aren't fully embracing the song, it's clear they're kind of enjoying it. arold and Kumar are singing along passionately to a third lame chick song. arold is holding onto the wheel for dear life. Kumar is scared as shit. They're both bouncing up and down. arold and Kumar are still bouncing up and down... arold and Kumar walk inside. Their shirts are torn and tattered, their bodies are scratched up, and they're covered in dirt. Everyone in the restaurant turns and stares at them. They approach the counter, where A TEENAGER STANDING... arold stops."

LIANE   leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she turns   on a record player, which starts playing a CREEPY SONG ABOUT   JESUS CHRIST. HAROLD and KUMAR look around the house. There   are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with Freak   Show and Liane's wedding picture... Oh, never been better.    We love each other very much. KUMAR looks disappointed.    HAROLD, however, is intrigued... Well, I met him at choir practice `bout four years ago. Freak Show was very shy back then-- you know, because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck. But he had the most amazing voice -- like a baby canary. Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- ""are we talking about the same Freakshow?"" Well, one day after Easter service, I told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and he just mustered up some courage and asked me out. The rest is history. And we've been in love ever since. HAROLD ponders this for a moment.    He and KUMAR begin drinking their lemonade. So you boys gonna fuck me or what? HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold. (a little offended) Oh, so just because we're passionate about our Lord, you assume we don't know how to have a good time? Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do me at the same time. Come on.   Give me the double stuff. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused. I want you both inside me simultaneously. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE... However you want to do it. Well...okay. (to Harold) Can you help me with this...? Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar, who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts. (to Harold, re: breasts) Do you want to play with them? Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane..."

I'm not your bro...bro. And if you feel like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy it. That's cool with me. I can find lots of people who want to get high. I can smoke it myself, man. One who understands the concept of supply and demand, dude. Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off. He takes out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole. (laughing like a prick) Dumbass. Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE, BLUE EYES, BIG BREASTS, BRITISH ACCENTS) approach carrying take-out bags. They see KUMAR and the Hippie Asshole making their deal. (to the Twins) Yeah. Wanna come back to my place? (butting in) Hey, my poetry isn't lame! It's actually quite good. The girls clearly aren't convinced. The ignore him and turn to Kumar. Hippie Asshole is oblivious to the fact he's not part of the crowd. Yeah, see you there. THE TWINS walk away. Kumar's excited. Hippie Asshole tries to pound fists with Kumar like they're all of a sudden friends. Kumar snubs him and runs off. Not cool, man. Uh, yeah. There's like, two hundred of them in this dorm. (to himself, but audible) `Tard. Cindy can't help but feel a little stupid. (to himself) Where the hell is 109, man? Harold is about to avoid him, but Kumar grabs Harold close and the two of them BASH INTO THE Hippie Asshole-- KNOCKING (reaching for the bag) Aw, dude! Don't take it! It's mine! He continues to protest as SECURITY GUARD #2 holds him down. 'S MOM Well, thank you for being so understanding about Bradley. I promise you he won't ever do it again. (shaken) Mom-- please take me home... The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a frightened child. Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on Harold... Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars..."

Revs the engine. ravis is focused on Mike, who is frozen in the street. ravis slams on the gas. ires screeching.   Travis guns it straight for Mike and Will. hey're about to dodge the car when- 76. he OLDER BOYS climb out the windows, ducking and covering their eyes from the ONSLAUGHT of bottle rockets and roman candle projectiles. he M-80's blow HUGE fist sized holes in the blacktop, bigger than can possibly be legal, exploding gravel peppering the kids, stunning them for a moment. ravis' boys cover their eyes but they make aggressive progress towards the kids with their terrifying M-80's. hey regroup at the mouth of the pier, water on both sides, Bowers in front. He throws another M-80, which tears into a wood plank. Splinters shoot everywhere. ravis and the others stop dead, incredulous, as rocks pelt them. It turns into a crazy rock fight. Will looks back. He can't see any of his friends who are on the other side of the house. he fight is getting desperate. Both Will and Mike bleed from rock hits. Will, Richie, and Mike see Bev waving them to come. They run for their lives towards the house, Travis and his goons on their heels. ravis and his buddies round the house. Moose walks right by the window they slipped into but doesn't seem to see it. he kids catch their breath and lick their wounds. The basement is a derelict and creepy undercarriage to a canal lock house. 80. ravis is getting frustrated. He can't find where or how the kids have gotten into the house. He looks straight at the window the kids crawled through, the 2x4 is still somehow attached from the outside. he kids can see Travis staring straight at them through the window, the 2x4 is non-existent, as if Pennywise is preventing the boys outside from seeing in or entering. hen Eddie suddenly stops. he kids have surrounded Eddie. hey sense what he is about to say isn't going to be good. he others ignore him, follow Ben and Mike up the stairs. he kids all file out, sticking close to the filthy walls. They dart into the dark parlor for the door, followed last by Richie... he room seems to extend and last longer than anticipated. Finally they get to the door. Ben tries it. Nailed shut. 84. he children, petrified, slide up the stairs as silently as possible, trying not to disturb the watching crows. Or alert whatever else is there. The stairs creak and snap loudly. hey get to a 2nd floor hallway, the wind from an open window blowing trash around. Will looks around... he other kids scream from the window. he fridge door starts to YAWN OPEN. Eddie curls in a ball and closes his eyes. he kids BANG on Mrs. Kaspbrak's door. She opens it, sees his broken arm and freaks. hey half-heartedly pat Mike on the back. he bartender brings Heroux a schooner of beer, one hardboiled egg in a bowl, a shaker of salt and some change. Heroux salts the egg and the beer, his piercing eyes stuck on he ax comes down into Eddie's ample gut. Blood sprays all the way up to the Dollar's beamed roof. he Loser's Club sits in front of Ben. hey look horrified. his is too much for Stan. He grabs his backpack. hey both startle and look at Will standing there. hey step inside.   Will pockets his Walkie and goes. ravis points to the cat that's lounging there in the grass. ravis pushes past his two cronies and goes over to the mailbox. Inside he pulls out THE KNIFE. The one he lost at the beginning. And attached to the string a note: 103. he drain. Will goes to it. Gazes down into the blackness. he front door creaks open, Victor and Snatch poking their heads in, both soaked to the bone. he STORM GROWLS outside. Richie, Ben and Eddie look at each other, a little on edge. Suddenly the doors crash open again and Stan stops, once again, looking up... he reading is over and the crowd starts to gather to leave for the reception. Will, Bev, Ben, Richie, Eddie, and Mike are all huddled together. Stan is the only one not there. his sinks in to everyone. There's only one thing they can do. he storm picks up force, wind blowing umbrellas inside out and from the hands of guests trudging back to the parking lot. One goes tumbling across the gardens and into... he other kids stock up on whatever armor or weapons they can find -- crossbow, hockey pads, a hubcap as shield, a sledgehammer, a hockey stick shaved into a stake, satchel full of car flares, hairspray. Stan is still processing what's going on. Mixed with their formal wear for the event, they look mildly ridiculous. he losers -- ALL 7 OF THEM -- stand on the threshold of the Old Ironworks cellar hold, the very same one PATRICK HOCKSTETTLER died in... a yawning chasm of mud, pools of water and hulking, shattered old boilers. he rain and wind howls, lightning cracking overhead. Will points to a huge SEWER PIPE that juts out of the muck. ravis, Snatch and Victor stand at the crest of the road leading to the factory. Travis has his dad's gun, aimed like Dirty Harry at them. He pops off another round, BLANG-PING. ravis glares at Snatch, PENNYWISE appearing near the boy in a flash of lightning. ravis lunges with the knife and plunges it into Snatch's tummy. Victor watches in horror. 115. hey dart into the blackness of the huge, rusty pipe. ravis turns back to Victor, a dull craze in his eyes.   He gestures to the conveyor the kids climbed down. he losers follow Will, who uses his dad's map to lead them deeper and deeper into the sewers which roar and chime with rushing water. They turn a corner and come to... he stream of water seems to disappear under the stone wall there. Everyone is terrified. hey all kick at the stones, which give way to... ravis and Victor race down the tunnels after them. They turn the corner and come to the dead end, a pile of stones kicked out from a BLACK HOLE. Travis kneels down and looks into it. He can see Will and the gang's FLASHLIGHTS... wo shadowy figures crawling toward them. 117. ravis bears down, his knife clenched in his teeth. ravis and Victor get to the corkscrew pass. There's no way Travis, huge compared to the other kids, will fit through. ravis grabs Victor by the scruff of the neck. A crooked, bloodthirsty look flashes across his ugly face. ravis hears the screaming, enjoying it. he whole cavern seems to be lit from within, a sickly, pulsing ambient light coming from everywhere and nowhere. hey're upside down now, the oculus opening to space below them, gravity seeming to work by its own rules in here.. he camera flips around and THE WORLD RIGHTS ITSELF, the oculus now above. The pool, which seemed small before, is now enormous -- like a dark, brooding lake -- the crypt island very far from them. hey splash toward the crypt island. Ben is the first to feel something brush past his leg. A replay of the quarry. he kids hustle it freestyle across the pool for the island. hey help Stan to his feet. Mike looks back over his shoulder for the monster. hey all nod and follow Will onto the structure, starry deep space through the oculus visible over their shoulders. They come to a child-sized TRAP DOOR with an ancient, cosmic marking. The only way in or out. he kids steal themselves, weapons ready. Mike hammers a clip into the stone and ties a rope to it. Nods all around. he door creaks open. Nothing but pure blackness inside. Mike throws down the rope. Will looks at Bev. he trapdoor slams shut and slices the rope. Will falls to the floor, flare falling into the water. It dims but doesn't go out. here's scuffling all around him. Close. Will dives into the water for the flare. Rises. Sweeps it around. he trapdoor above them blows away, as if it were sucked off by a cyclone, out of the oculus, and into what looks like the stars of outer space. he water from the waterfalls and from the reflecting pool all collapse back toward the floor, along with some of the stones in the crypt around them, which begins to crumble. hey all plunge safely into the new pool below, Will's foot kicking out the bottom of it into outer space before being pulled back by Stan. he losers hurry their way out of the sewers, storm water quickly rising around them. Will leads the way with a car flare. They come to another dead-end grate. hey continue to look for a way out, the water now up to their chests. The losers look cold, lost, and in despair. he sky is blue.   The storm has passed. hey gather themselves on the bank, breathing hard as the adrenaline of survival courses through their veins. hey all clasp hands and lock eyes. A BLOOD OATH IS SWORN. ravis, hair now SHOCK WHITE, expression blank and broken, sits in his chair in front of white fuzz of the TV. His father's corpse is still on the floor, blood matted everywhere. POUNDING ON THE FRONT DOOR. 131. hey have a group hug. hey pull out of the driveway, camera on Will's lap. Zach and Sharon smile back affectionately from the front seat."
1,it,W,"ritten by ill (13), his older brother,   sits up in bed propped against a pile of pillows, surrounded   by tissues and sheets of newspaper. HEADLINES and TOYS   tell us this is the late 80's -- October, 1987 to be exact. He   puts finishing touches on ill, annoyed, picks up the walkie-talkie.   While looking through his rain blasted window. ill coughs hard into a tissue. Half-impatient, half-joking: ill turns off the walkie-talkie. ill melts a chunk of paraffin with a match in a ceramic bowl, then dips his finger into the hot liquid and smears the wax along the sides of the boat. ill Denbrough laces his shoes. As he leaves his room, he notices the door to George's room is open, his FATHER, ZACH DENBROUGH (30s), lost in thought notices him. ill looks like he wants to say more, but doesn't have the words to articulate it. ill elbows him. ill, Rich, and Eddie speed past the library. 16. ill is studying the sneaker. ill comes sloshing up. He flips Richie the sneaker. ill has to fish it back out of the water. ill and Eddie race in, leaving Ben and Richie in the alley which is emblazoned with a COLORFUL MURAL about the FBI's ambush of the infamous Bradley Gang, a celebrated slice of Derry town history. ill pulls out one crumbled dollar. ill fishes the EPI-PEN from the fanny pack. ill and Eddie race out laughing. Bev is waiting on the curb to meet them. She flips Will the stolen goods. ill steps out. ill lays out on the carpet in front of the TV, eating ice cream from a carton. His parents sit on opposite ends of the couch like bookends, father flips through a Popular Mechanics. His mom stares at the TV, her mind elsewhere. There seems to be no connection between any of them. ill's dad throws the magazine down. ill flips back his covers. ill grabs a bucket from a utility closet and, walking back, sees Georgie's room's door open... ill enters, the room frozen in time. GEORGIE'S TOY BOX is open. Photographs and posters line the walls. 43. ill sits down, Turtle in hand, and indulges in the sadness that has engulfed his home for months. The loss of his brother hitting him full force, he closes his eyes to fight back the tears, but cannot. ill looks up but no one is there. ill steps out of George's room and finds DARK FOOTPRINTS IN THE CARPET. He leans down and touches one -- squishy and wet. They track down the dark staircase. ill, heart pounding, follows the wet footprints down the stairs, careful not to step in any of them. ill sees a YELLOW FLASH of something ducking around the corner. Startled, Will drops the Lego turtle, which smashes into pieces and scatters across the wood floor... ill looks back up the stairs half-expecting his parents to wake up. Nothing but an eerie silence. He gathers his courage and follows the wet footprints into... 44. ill steps in, face to face with THE CELLAR DOOR, the door creaking closed, light snapped on behind it, footprints disappearing down into the cellar. ill slowly approaches the door and reaches out for the handle, but stops with second thoughts. He starts backing away, too spooked to go down, when he hears... ill opens the door, rickety stairs leading down into darkness, the weeper somewhere in the recesses, along with the steady sound of a LEAK. ill looks up toward the leak/weeping sound and sees, curled in the same corner where we had that opening POV... ill moves to step into the water when he hesitates, holding his foot over it. He looks to Georgie whose expression of distress seems insincere. ill grabs a rake from the wall and pokes its tip into the water. It's a good six inches deep. ater and muck pour from his mouth as he says these last words, an endless cascade. ill recoils. Georgie glides over the water towards Will, and we realize there is a creature beyond it, the colors of a clown's costume, PENNYWISE, propping up Georgie's body like a MEAT PUPPET. ill slams the door on Pennywise's/Georgie's gross face. ill slams the door of his room and hides in his bed. Panting. The DOOR KNOB starts to rattle. ill exhales, safety. ill points at it but nothing registers for Zach. ill and Zach stand over the stairwell. Zach turns the light on and walks down, much to Will's horror, into a puddle of water. ill holds himself, too freaked out to speak. ill, Stan, Richie, Ben and Eddie stand at the edge of a police cordon. Beyond, CHIEF BORTON and A LINE OF POLICE OFFICERS, SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES and VOLUNTEERS sweep the woods with blood hounds. ill, who was more interested in a Viewmaster, turns and looks at the walls now. Sees a copy of an old-timey document with 300 signatures. INCORPORATION OF THE TOWNSHIP OF DERRY. ill can't take his eyes off all of the information. ill, Richie, Eddie, Stan, and Ben, stripped to their tightie- whities (except Ben who still has a T-shirt), stand in a line staring at the edge of a rocky outcropping in a quarry turned pond. The black water of the pond foreboding, endless. ill sits up and looks out at the water. It is so black it seems other worldly. Not breaking his stare from the water, he addresses the group. ill whips his neck to Beverly. He can't tell if she is making fun or if she is seriously asking him for a bridge. ill, Stan and Eddie look at Ben. ill, Richie and Eddie go with Bev. ill, Richie, and Eddie follow her to a closed door at the end of the hallway -- THE BATHROOM DOOR ill goes to Eddie, who still stands frozen in terror. ill, Richie, Ben and Bev clean like grim elves, using a bucket of hot water, ajax, and some cloth rags. Slowly the blood washes out. Reaching for the same rag, Will and Bev's hands touch, a spark between them. 58. ill pours the last of pink bucket water down the bathtub drain. The bathroom now as clean as it ever was. The bucket is filled with blood stained rags. ater spews up from the drain with more and more pressure, a pool now covering the floor, the edge of which seeps toward Mike. 69. ill, Richie, Stan, and Eddie have gathered on Ben's roof to watch the fireworks. 71. ill smiles. ill points to their arsenal of fireworks. ill and his gang see this and take a short cut of their own. Ben, boy-boobs jiggling, takes up the rear. ill sees this. ill finds the backpack empty as Mike shoots off the last bottle rocket. Will picks up some rocks as ammo. Mike and Richie instinctively follow suit. Will winds up and... ill, Richie and Mike round the corner of the house.   Will looks down the pier, no one, then THEY HEAR BEN. ill sees a broomstick wave in the opening, beckoning them to come in. ill watches Travis and his boys walk past the basement window again. Ben looks to Beverly, sees some gravel in her leg like buckshot. ill covers Eddie's mouth as he continues to yell, ""we shouldn't be here."" They watch anxiously as Travis and the boys feet inch uncomfortably closer to them. ill looks to the gang, they all nod.     He turns back to their newest member. ill grabs on to Beverly's hand. She holds onto his with equal vigor. Richie holds onto Eddie. ill nods.    Let's go. ill reads his mind, an upstairs window might be their only chance to freedom. ill leads the way upstairs. ill, Mike, and Ben rush back into the house. ill runs around the gaping hole in the floor and tries to run down the stairs when... ill covers his eyes as the birds prevent him from going down. Mike and Ben shore themselves behind him. ill, Mike, and Ben are being pelted by the birds still. They retreat back into the bedroom and shut the door. ill sees the blood, looks to Ben and Mike. ill, Mike and Ben look over to see what broke their fall- a just as startled Pennywise, writhing in anger. ill enters the back door and grabs Stan's invitation for his Bar-Mitzvah off the fridge: ill shoulders past his father and runs out the door. ill sits on the curb across from the storm drain that killed Georgie. His eyes burn with anger. He stares into the dark void, half expecting Pennywise's face to appear any moment. 98. ill bikes up to the edge of the hulking old structure.   He clocks the river flowing just beyond. ill sees Bev's mom leave for work, then bikes around back where he clocks a tangle of pipes protruding from the back of the building down into a MORLOCK HOLE marked Derry Sewer. ill tramps down to the spot where he found the shoe. He looks back down the stream, water trickling out of the sewer pipe into the Barrens. The water. ill bikes up to the mouth of the pier, the house suspended over the canal, its imploded facade seeming to gape back at Will like Munch's ""The Scream."" Water again. In Will's mind, it all comes together. 99. ill realizes something. ill hands him his invite. ithout thinking Bev grabs the toilet top and smashes it in her dad's face. He slumps down, unconscious. ill and Mike tear through the howling rain on their bikes. They almost collide into Beverly who comes dashing around a corner. ith torrential downpour outside, leaking water drips from the ceiling onto the crowd below, who have cheerfully employed umbrellas indoor to deal with the nuisance. ill, Bev, and Mike slink into the back of the synagogue, soaking wet. The Rabbi's wife shoots them a look of daggers. ater is actively dripping on them. ill and the gang arrive like their own hurricane in the dark cellar workshop. Whipping around the room and picking up objects, Will unfurls a map on his dad's work table. ill steps up to Stan. ill opens the back window and the kids slip out. ill grabs Bev's hand, who grabs Ben's who grab's Eddie's and on down the line. They follow Will around the cellar hold to a giant conveyor belt toppled against the edge. They scale down it into the chasm, bullets pinging around them. ill and the others slosh on their hands and knees down the hole, with roots and bursting through its stone ribs. ill, leading them, comes to a SMALL CORKSCREW in a tangle of roots blocking them they all have to wrench their way around. ill is pointing. Beverly follows his eyes to the knife in Victor's hand, which has PUNCTURED THE MEMBRANE. 119. ill, Ben, Bev, Mike, Eddie, Stan and Richie stumble from the dark into a massive, soaring, subterranean Pantheon-like hall, sewer water streaming past their feet... ill heads toward the edge of the oculus, where the waterfalls stream up. ill sees Beverly over by one of the waterfalls. ill and the boys swap holy shit looks.   Ben jumps in after her, then Will, Mike, and Stan. ill, then Bev, then Richie dodge a tentacle and all get to the island. Stan is not far behind, with Mike, Eddie and Ben taking the rear, swatting back more tentacles. ill looks back to the crypt, an obsidian stone heptagon- shaped structure the size of one of Mike's killing pens. ill takes a breath, drops in... ill shimmies down about 5 feet of rope and lights a car flare, illuminating the chamber in a blood red pall. The walls inside are rough, like the surface of a meteor. ill turns just in time for the eyes to recede into the black. The pounding on the trap door has stopped. ill drops his bag of flares and scrambles off, tripping over the hole in the floor, leg sloshing in the pool. ill finds a corner, the flare running out of spark. He waves it this way and that, illuminating the dark in front of him. Swinging his baseball bat wildly at shadows. ill looks at the last light of his flare, waiting for the end. He looks the bat in his clutch only to see it's morphed into... ill sees all of ""IT"" now. From his bare crusty feet to his bald head. His claw-like hands and his emaciated acrobat- like body. He floats just a few inches over the stone floor. ill's eyes fall to the baseball bat half-way between them. He lunges for it, Pennywise knocking it away. The clown seizes his neck, smiles hungrily, bares his twisted fangs. ill grabs Ben's sledgehammer. The creature that looks up at them isn't Pennywise but... GEORGIE ill is confused. This is the one thing he wanted to hear. Beverly hands him his satchel with the car flares. ill looks to the scared little boy on the ground. ill grabs his stake away. He turns to Georgie.   Kneels down. Takes his wet little head in his hands. ill isn't sure, he looks at the rest of them. ill, Bev, Mike, Ben, Richie, Eddie and Stan slump soaked, shivering, and exhausted on the embankment. Derry is in full view across the river, a red ball setting behind it. ill knows exactly what this means. He steps up to Stan, who SLASHES Will'S PALM with the shard. One by one the others approach, Stan slashing everyone's palms, does his own last. ill stands at the curb with his gang -- Richie, Ben, Bev, Eddie, Stan, and Mike. They hand him a present. ill does. Inside is a VINTAGE PENTAX CAMERA. ill turns to see his friends wave bon voyage with their SCARRED HANDS. A reminder of an oath to be kept."
2,it,H,"e steels himself and plunges into the void. e goes. Will looks to the rain-lashed window, piano still playing. He's suddenly filled with a sense of foreboding. e walks over to the drain and peers in, water falling into darkness. A dank hollow sound comes from within. Suddenly e hands it to Mike, expectantly. Mike dispassionately takes the mechanism and approaches a sheep. e places it on the head of the next sheep, but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. andsome, gangly, red-headed, the memory of his brother still fresh. He walks with his dorky friends, all talking over each other: EDDIE KASPBRAK, his EPI-PEN JR. (an adrenaline injector for kids with life-threatening allergies) holstered in his medicine-filled fannypack; STAN URIS (12), a trim and tidy Jewish kid who dresses like a mini-accountant; and RICHIE TOZIER, the neighbor with the walkie-talkie, a comic book and video game freak with bug-eye glasses. e turns to see Beverly. e steps aside. Beverly tip-toes past, lighting a cigarette like a pro. e holds the paper limply in his hands. She doesn't acknowledge him and instead gets up and slides the doors shut to the piano room. e glances at a newspaper behind her: ""BODY FOUND NEAR CANAL NOT THAT OF COEN YOUTH, BORTON ANNOUNCES."" Safe. er Mother, MRS. MARSH (30s), a former prom queen long since faded, watching her. Studying her. e starts to lose attention as he looks around the ornate room and the beams of light fingering out from the windows. e lets him go. e can't find the bathroom, but he does see the Mikveh--a cleansing room for the women of a synogogue during their monthlies. It drips water and is lit by a spare light bulb. e backs away and quickly zips up his pants. er hands slowly move towards her pussy, touching herself. Stanley starts to back away. ockstettler jettisons a fireball with his make-shift flame thrower, just past Ben's head. e turns to see BEN STUMBLE FROM THE WOODS all bloody. Eddie screams and sloshes out into the stream he was so assiduously avoiding. 27. e starts peddling faster. Sees the KITCHENER IRONWORKS sign ahead and skids right down its path towards the ghostly titanic ruin. e nears the CELLAR HOLD, a yawning chasm on the edge of the ruins. Sees a Derry Historical Society PLAQUE: ockstettler notices something off screen.    Walks towards it. e looks back at Travis and the others, who are sniffing out the weeds near the river. e points towards the door leading to the dark innards of the factory. ockstettler watches them leave, a cloud of dust in their place, then turns towards the darkest parts of the factory, as if pulled deeper into the core unconsciously. ockstettler takes out his lighter and hairspray, launching a fire ball that illuminates the cavern below. 31. ockstettler saw IT, but doesn't believe it. He unleashes another fire ball. For a second we see the faces of DEAD CHILDREN amongst the monoliths. ockstettler isn't sure if he's seen right. He walks in, the hair rising on the back of his neck. ockstettler carefully maneuvers his way down into the hold. His feet, blindly tapping for purchase. e freezes.   Did he hear that or was that in his head? ockstettler lights a ball of hair spray, it illuminates the walls near him, but nothing far away. e moves down deeper. Lights the hair spray again, and for second, we think we glimpsed, deeper in the shadows, Pennywise. e lifts up his hair spray can, finger shaking on the plastic nozzle, he lifts the lighter. CLINK. The flint lights up the small flame. Sputtering in the flowing air in the cellar. His breathing is arrhythmic, compressed. e sprays. The flame spits out and out of the darkness, PENNYWISE the clown leaps onto Hockstettler, tumbling him into the cellar hold, he drops the lighter and hairspray, which rolls down to the feet of a child. A DEAD CHILD. e flips Ben his medicine. Stan runs up from behind, still looking blanched from his synogogue experience. e sees Ben there, looking like a train wreck. is parents flash looks. is dad stops mid flip, all the air going out of the room. e storms out to his workshop. Sharon is too upset to look her son in the eye. is arm shoots out and GRABS HER WRIST LIKE A VICE. 41. e stalks past, dragging her behind him. They step into... e shoves her against the wall. Hard. e points back to the gory sink. e steps over and grabs the BLOOD-COATED TAPE, clipping it onto his belt, blood on his hands now too. He doesn't seem to see any of it. Only Beverly can. She realizes this. e raises his hand. e lowers his hand, gentle now, proprietary. 42. e rests his forehead against hers, breathes in her scent, goes back down the hall to his game. e cries for George. Photographs of George, illuminated by passing cars, seem to watch him from the walls. orrified, Will races up the stairs as... e looks at Mike, searching for any indication what this could be about. Travis appears in the distance and Mike instantly knows. e grabs Officer Bowers by the arm. Bowers quickly and excessively puts Leroy in a wrist lock and throttles him against the killing pen fence. Leroy moans in pain. e sees a bloody rag on the counter and picks it up, wiping his sweaty face, smearing blood all over it. e shuts the lid, pulls back into the passenger seat, and screams to the driver, Victor. e coughs again. Mike can smell the creeping death coming from his father's insides. e coughs again. 65. e seems to float off into a reverie. e stops, the water rushing past his feet. He looks back behind him, the normally lit hallway now far far away. e hears the sheep just inside the open door. He enters through it without noticing the stencil on the glass of the door: ""DERRY COUNTY CORONER."" e's pounding on the door. e looks over his shoulder while continuing to BANG. The tray inside the open locker slowly slides out, like a tongue from a mocking black mouth. On it, under a white sheet, is a CORPSE. e opens his palms, revealing SEVERAL M-80s.     The boys collectively `woah' with excitement. e does it Rick James style. Everyone laughs. e looks at their feet. They all do. Water coming in fast. Ben bangs a coal stoker against the boarded window. Rock solid. Will looks for a way out. The stairs. e beckons them into a bedroom with AN OPEN WINDOW. They step over a moldy bare mattress shoved against the wall. e holds it up and the lower part of his arm hangs irregularly. Behind him the old refrigerator SHAKES, SOMETHING INSIDE. e devours the egg, downs the beer, then lets out a belch. The man next to him gives a friendly nod. Heroux doesn't respond. He kicks back from the bar, dragging his ax behind. eroux walks past a piano being played, whispers something into the players ear, then throws the change from his meal -- $1.85 -- onto the piano top. The piano player tips his hat and changes tune to something more festive, manic almost. eroux continues into the back, walking like a man in a half dream. eroux's ax falls, chopping of Floyd's hand at the wrist. Floyd recoils back shrieking, blood spurting from the stump, his severed hand remaining on the table. eroux bury his ax in Tinker McCutchoen's head. The big man tries to get up, blood pouring down his face, then sits back down again. A second chop finishes him. eroux turns to Ed Katook, who struggles to pull his clutch pistol from its shoulder holster. He slings the ax sideways just as Katook gets the pistol out, burying it in his back. 93. eroux pulls the ax out of his gut like you would a softwood tree, rocking it back and forth. It finally comes free and he brings it down again. e finds the windowless room empty. A sound comes from deep in the pooping hole. He looks down just in time to see... eroux steps out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back room. Exhausted and bloody from tip to toe, he takes a seat at the card table, props his ax next to him, and starts drinking what's left of the slaughtered men's beers. e hears fighting in the hallway. is mother stands in the way of his father who holds the chest of Georgie's toys. is mother hits him hard. She instantly regrets it. She runs down the stairs sobbing. Zach reaches out a comforting hand. e listens for a response. Nothing. Just the bubbling sound of water rushing through the sewer. Water. Something dawns on Will. undreds of black ravens, the same birds from Neibolt, watch him from perches all along the skeletal structure. is walkie crackles from a high shelf over the TV. Mrs. Kaspbrack looks at her son, eyebrows raised. e grabs the walkie, holds it tenderly in his hands. e complies.   BANG BANG BANG.   They both look at the door. e finally tags it, the bottle shattering into a thousand pieces. They all whoop and holler. e reaches for the gun.    Bowers pushes him back. e stalks up and grabs the gun from Travis. Smells it. e shoots the ground around     Travis feet. Travis squeals like a girl, utterly terrified.      BLAM! BLAM! A large wet stain spreads around his crotch.      Butch Bowers raises the pistol, as if he were about to whip     Travis, who falls to the ground. e spits out his disgust, stalks inside. e snaps the string and starts toward the front door with the knife. The balloon floats up into the darkening sky. e shoves her against the wall, eyes her little body up and down. Caresses her hair. e squeezes her cheeks with one hand, holding her head in place. e looms over her. Something in his manner is detached. Like he's there but isn't there. e pulls out Ben's Haiku Poem. e grabs her by the hair and pulls her up to him. 106. e drags her down the hall by the hair. e throws her into his bedroom. e unbuckles his belt, but he doesn't look at her like he wants to whip her, there's another hunger in his eyes. e slides off his belt and grabs her, smiling, a smile that feels all too reminiscent of a clown. e pulls out his Epi-pen and throws it in the trash.   Mrs. Kaspbrak gasps. e holds the .45, All slicked in blood, his eyes glazed. e turns and looks at Snatch and Victor in the doorway. 111. e shines his light on something in the corner... e starts squealing like a pig. Ben is freaked. Two pair of hands grab Ben's arms and yank hard. He wrenches through the corkscrew and stumbles out into... e puts the knife into Victor's hand and points to keep going.

Seriously. I don't know why we're down here. There's poison ivy and mosquitos and God knows what else could get us sick. Not to mention we're all alone down here. What if we run into that psycho who's been picking off kids. 25. RICHIE Guys--                          I overheard my mom talking to my aunt in Bangor. She says it's a sex fiend. Some drifter.

Fag you later. I found something today. That missing Coen boy. I found a clue. 38. What about Arcadia? (CONT'D) We haven't talked about our park trip at the end of the summer.

(CONT'D) Don't worry about it. Why do you have all this stuff anyway? I mean. What are you going to do with it? Who's first. I'll go first. Do you guys ever feel there's something wrong with Derry. Like it's, I don't know, haunted or something? I keep thinking about Ben's walls. Yeah.   It's strange. I... If I tell you guys something you won't think I'm crazy. I saw Georgie last night.   Only. It wasn't him. No. In my house, he tried to get me to go into the basement with him. 55. Shut up Richie. It wasn't just him. I saw this other... I don't know. Yes. That's what it was, a scary looking clown. And it had these teeth... We should leave lookouts. Ben, Stan, can you? What happened? You okay, Eddie? Eddie Kaspbrack? (CONT'D) Ed. Go outside. Get Ben and send him in here. (CONT'D) You see it, don't you, Richie? (CONT'D) We can't leave it like this.    Let's clean it up. Okay, so how did he put Georgie in my basement? You okay? We know what's been taking the kids. Chief! No, we all saw it. I guess we're on our own. Think that could take ""IT"" down? What we're scared of. It was Georgie's corpse for me cuz, cuz that's what I care about. It was a naked woman for Stan because he's so afraid of- Back to point. It showered Beverly in blood cuz... It. It's everything and anything. All our nightmares. All evil, wrapped into one. They want to get closer.   See their tricks. (CONT'D) Shit. Isn't that- With these. Don't move. Trust us. We're here to help you take these jerks. (into the walkie-talkie) Not yet... not yet. Now! Oh shit. Abort! Abort! Run! Real as it gets... Now, Stan and Eddie! I don't wanna stay and find out. Leave us alone Bowers. I don't want anyone to get seriously hurt. Okay. Ben, we'll hold him off while we can, you and Stan see if you can find a way in. Charge!!! (CONT'D) (TO BEN) Guys hurry!!! Go! Go! Go! Shhhhush. RICHIE Eddie?                             He's afraid of dirt. What? Something's wrong with Derry. Haunting it. Hunting and killing kids. We've all seen it. Stairs. C'mon. Eddie! Eddie. We tried, we can't get down stairs. Do you see anything you could use to climb out? What do we do? Ah, fuck! Who know what's going on. BEVERLY I think it's pretty obvious.      Derry's not just haunted, it's cursed. Exactly. No one listened to him like no one listens to us. And unless we do something, ""IT's"" never going to stop. We can kill it. I don't think that's a choice, Stan. ""IT"" knows we know. We hurt it. It's going to want to hurt us back. We're all scared. That's what it feeds off of. I heard the clown tell Eddie as much. Our only defense is to stick together. 96. Hey. Why? To scream at each other more? 97. And Georgie right? You, dad, and Georgie. No. You stop. I hate   it. Tip toeing around you guys like   I don't exist. Like I'm the one who   died and the only one who's still   here is Ge-- What do you care? At least she heard me. I miss Georgie, too. Do you? Because it seems like every adult in this town is blind to what's really happening, blind to what any of us kids are going through. C'mon, clown. Show your ugly face! I'll stick another firecracker in it for Georgie. Blow your whole stupid head off. Send you back to wherever a creeper like you comes from. Where are you!? (O.S.) Eddie? Eddie you there? (O.S.) Eddie? I know where to find-- The sewers. ""IT."" Whenever it shows up, there's always water around. The storm drain where Georgie died. The leak in my room. Beverly's sink. I'll bet if you trace every terrible event in Derry you'll find the same thing. Water. With the Penobscot river on one side and Kenduskeag canal cutting through it's impossible to escape. Shit, Stan's bar mitzvah.   I almost forgot. You are now. Let's go! Bev. You okay? 109. What?   What did he do Beverly? Not someone. ""IT"". The sewers. Me and Mike figured it out. That's how it gets around. That's where it lives. 112. The sewers. We go in. All of us. Get rid of ""IT"" before ""IT"" gets rid of us, one by one. It doesn't know what to do when all of us are together, you have to believe me. C'mon! We need to protect each other Stan. The seven of us is all we have. Together ""IT"" can't hurt us. I promise. I have faith. Just like you. (YELLING) This is our only way into Derry's original sewer system before it was sealed off and modernized. Don't look back! There's suppose to be a tunnel here. The last tunnel that's shown on the map. Keep moving! Don't jiggle it too much, whatever you do. Victor. It doesn't matter what it calls itself. What matters is it's afraid to show us what it really is. Which means we can beat it. Beverly, wait-! We all here? Guys, the island.    Let's swim. Hurry! (CONT'D) Stan what are you doing! (CONT'D) Stan, it's us. You in there buddy? Maybe. Or just changing into something else. It's using our fears against us. It wants us to be afraid. We have to stick together, to help each other against that kind of fear you only have when you're alone. Alright? (CONT'D) Ready? 124. (CONT'D) My turn. I'm not afraid of you, clown. Guys? (CONT'D) Ahhhh! (CONT'D) Come out from the dark then. Come out from behind that stupid mask and show me what you really are. C'mon! I'm sorry, Georgie. You're not Georgie. 127. No!   I have to think. No. (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go out there with you. I'm sorry I was sick. Hairspray. We've got to get out of here. 129. We'll get out. C'mon. No. I don't know-- Swear, guys. Swear if IT isn't dead, if it ever returns, we'll come back and fight it together. Thanks. 133."
