0,avengers,TONY,"You're good on this end. The rest is up to you. Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy. I assume. Light her up. As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP. Like Christmas, but with more... me. Pepper, you're killing me. Remember? Enjoy the moment. I'm not in. I'm actually out. Close the line Jarvis. I got a date. Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius? What do you mean? All this came from you. Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit. An argument can be made for fifteen. Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you. My private elevator... ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I? Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne. I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower. ...Call your mom, can you bunk over? You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message. Then leave it urgently. At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears. Security breach. Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent. Which is why he can't stay. I don't like being handed things. Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday. The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify. Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others. Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own databases. You know, I thought we were having a moment. How did you notice? Why is he Phil? This is, uh... Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and Pepper. This. Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS Tomorrow. Well, what if I didn't? Yeah. Square deal. It's the last date. Pepper kisses him. What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily? Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates? It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle. Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match. Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you. THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake violently. Then don't take my stuff. Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes? He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist. The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mj�lnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree. Okay. From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mj�lnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch! Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mj�lnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back. How about that? IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up. It's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; to (CONT'D) Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube. Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading? Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect. Finally, someone who speaks English. It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. Shall we play, doctor? If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.  Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony. Nothing? You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed? Funny things are. You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut. You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables. He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it? That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now. I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files. Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. (holds out a bag of blueberries) Blueberry? An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible. Following is not really my style. (a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use? That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice. What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. (CONT'D) It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does. Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us. You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege. Because I learned how. Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.  You just might. Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you. And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed. I'm sorry, Nick. Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of What were you lying? Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down. (puts his arm around Steve) Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam? (comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. I think I would just cut the wire. (that did it) A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle! Got it. Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer. I can get there faster. You gonna stop me? I'm not afraid to hit an old man. Yep! Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE. (V.O.) I'm on it! Find engine three. I'll meet you there. Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory. Good. See what we got. Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged engine. I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris. Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push. Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag... See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it. Cap, I need the lever! Lever. Now! Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the rotors, getting chewed up. No. There was a uh...cellist, I think. He was an idiot. For taking on Loki alone. He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...  (turns around sharply) WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife! (looking at the blood stained That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why? He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered... Shut it down, Dr. Selvig. Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock. TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into the penthouse. Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you. Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.   (CONT'D) But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them. Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you. From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE BRACELETS, a honing device. We have a HULK. You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it. Well, performance issues. You know? In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room. Jarvis. Anytime now. Loki grabs Tony by the throat again. Right. Army. IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN flies towards the city. Fine. Let's keep them occupied. IRON MAN heads back to the portal. I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet? Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot. IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you. IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently. Nice call. What else you got? And he didn't invite me? I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just where to put it.  What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me? Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it. And then shawarma after."
1,avengers,NICK FURY,"How bad is it? NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase. What are the energy levels now? How long to get everyone out? Do better. We should tell them to go back to sleep? I need you to make sure that PHASE 2 prototypes are shipped out. Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone. Talk to me, doctor. DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned. The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings shoot out at random. Is there anything we know for certain? Is that supposed to be funny? How soon until you pull the plug? We've prepared for this, doctor. Harnessing energy from space. That can be harmful. Where's Barton? Agent Barton, report. BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They both walk around the facility in a discreet manner. I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things. Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off? At this end? Sir, please put down the spear! Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss Loki's fired shot. ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him. In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost gone to shit. Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.  We have no quarrel with your people. You planning to step on us? Free from what? Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing. From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion. Like The Pharaohs of Odin. (through the walkie talkie) Hill, do you copy?! Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill. Barton is... He's got the Tesseract! Track it down! The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling. The Tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill? Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case. Coulson, get back to base. This is a LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at war. A beat. You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control? Not Asgard. Loki. Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us. PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team. This isn't about The Avengers. I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need. No, it's won by soldiers. Trouble sleeping? Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. He sits down. We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently. I am. Trying to save it. Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on HYDRA'S projects. Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs. He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know. Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment. Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of the gym. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now? Good. Let's vanish. Gentlemen. Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it. Doctor, thank you for coming. Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear. How many are there? Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please. Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall. Captain, you're up. Steve nods. Leaves. (V.O.) Said anything? (V.O.) Just get him here. We're low on time. With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering. In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass. Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though. Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?! Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki. Ant. Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap. Boot. Built for something a lot stronger than you. How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control. (CONT'D) You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.   I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. (O.S.) War hasn't started yet. A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops. I'm asking. What are you prepared to do? Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? Thor doesn't answer.  You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract. (trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're... Because of him. (pointing at Thor) Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned. But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled. You forced our hand. We had to come up with something. Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark? Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up? You need to step away. Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr.Banner back to his... The cell was just in case... Hill?! Stark! You copy that?! Coulson! Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! Move out! Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water. Is the sun coming up?! Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop. We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE appears. Get his attention. They are not getting through here, so what the hell... Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB It's Barton. He took out our systems. He's headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy? (V.O.) Stark, we're losing altitude. Just stay awake. EYES ON ME! Not an option. (V.O.) Agent Coulson is down. Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up. (V.O.) They're here. (V.O.) They called it. These were in Phil Coulson's jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD. We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming. Well, it's an old fashioned notion. Agent Hill? They needed the push. (holding Coulson's cards) A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying off as well as the QUINJET. They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything. I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision, I've elected to ignore it. That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. Until I'm certain my team can't hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population. I send that bird out, we already have. Fury shuts off his viewscreen. RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG- 7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED. Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there, knowing he can't do anything about it. Stark, you hearing me? We have a missile headed straight for the city. Three minutes, at best. Stay low and wipe out the missile. I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a leave of absence. The Tesseract is where it belongs: out of our reach. I didn't make it. I just didn't argue with the god that did. Oh, I think he will be. They surely are. And the whole world knows it. Every world knows it. A promise. They'll come back. I am. Because we'll need them to."
2,avengers,LOKI,"You have heart. Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands straight. As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract, placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then... Please don't. I still need that. Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose. An ant has no quarrel with a boot. I come with glad tidings, of a world made free. Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart... Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart. Selvig's eyes glow BLACK. You will know peace. Well, then... Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling. Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle. Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim. I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed! You don't have the Tesseract yet. THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter. I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton? Tell me what you need. Kneel before me. The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd. Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their spears, encircling the crowd. I said. KNEEL!!! Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing his arms out, smiling. Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel. As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN refuses to kneel and stands, heroic. There are no men like me. Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.  Kneel. I'm not overly fond of what follows. What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet. Not a light. A King. THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony puts the IRON MAN helmet on.  Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth. Thor drops MJ�LNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up Loki. His brother. Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god. Did you mourn? Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them.   Well, yes. I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it... I am a king! I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where. Mj�lnir flies back to his grasp. I'm listening.  Oh, I've heard. Loki looks into the camera. The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you? Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is. There's not many people that can sneak up on me. (turns to see NATASHA After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate. I'd say I've expanded his mind. Is this love, Agent Romanoff?  And what will you do if I vow to spare him?  What is it you want? Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? DRAKOV'S daughter? S�O PAULO? THE HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? (V.O.) You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury oversees. (V.O.) You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away! - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF I won't touch Barton. Not until I make him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In every way he knows you fear! And when he'll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams, I'll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.   Are you ever not going to fall for that? (smiles; walks over to the  Your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky...where is my disadvantage? I don't think I... Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity. You should have left your armor on for that. Stalling me won't change anything. The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear? Yes, I've met them. That was the plan. I have an army. I thought the beast had wandered off. (slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you? Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing. Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING. It should work. You will all fall before me. LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower. From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out. The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit. It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry. You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only the war! (tries to look away) It's too late. It's too late to stopit. Sentiment. Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of CHITAURI follow his lead. Send the rest.  If it's all the same to you. I'll have that drink."
4,avengers,BANNER,"Calm down. What's wrong? Is he like them? The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world. Should have got paid up front, Banner. Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns around, quietly. Avoiding stress isn't the secret. You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded? And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young? Who are you? Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone. SHIELD. How did they find me? Why? What if I said no? And what if the... other guy says no? I don't always get what I want. Well, those I actively try to avoid. What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it? So Fury isn't after the monster? And he tells you everything? He needs me in a cage?  I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha... Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece. Just you and me? Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down. Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming. Is that the only word on me? (takes in the sentiment) Must be strange for you, all of this. Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container? They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE  Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying? Where are you with that? Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen. You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to? Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? He really grows on you, doesn't he? So he's building another portal. That's what he needs Erik Selvig for. He's an astrophysicist. I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him. Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for? He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier. Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.  Let's play some. As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing. The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process. All I packed was a tooth brush. Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.  No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things. (bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and... 'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube. (pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news. It's powered by Stark Reactors, self- sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year? (referring to Tony) So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place? Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off. The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us. And I'll read all about it. Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare. But you can control it. It's different. Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face. So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life? (CONT'D) That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what? You might not like that. We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile. Did you know about this? I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed. And you've been doing what exactly? Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction. It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're... we're a time-bomb. Yeah, this is a tee... Where? You rented my room. In case you needed to kill me, but you can't! I know! I tried! You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm? BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns. Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all. Oh, my God! Your life? His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the lights go out.  Lucky. You saw? Thank you. A beat. What? No. So, this all seems horrible. Sorry. That's my secret, Captain. I'm always angry. Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN"
5,avengers,THOR,"Where is the Tesseract? Do I look to be in a gaming mood?! I thought you dead. We all did. Our father... We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that? So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki. You think yourself above them. Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up to the ledge. Turns around. Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king? Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home. You listen well, brother. I... and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up. IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet opens up. Do not touch me again! You have no idea what you're dealing with. This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice! and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face. Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor, with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest. IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up, ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift him and SMASH him down hard. Thor summons back Mj�lnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him, but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce... CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN, stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand. I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!  , CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.  Selvig? He's a friend. Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother. He's adopted. Monkeys? I do not understand. Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man. They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we...we come here battling like BILCHSTEIM. BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those? They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come. When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him. What are you asking me to do? Loki is a prisoner.  My people want nothing but peace with your planet. You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war. Did you always give your champions such mistrust? You speak of control, yet you court chaos. You people are so petty... and tiny. Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap. Located the Tesseract? The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it. Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him. We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to think! HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM  Nooo! Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch. He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful. Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it! So be it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself. Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule? No. We can. Together. Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over. The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable. I have unfinished business with Loki. rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting off SOLDIERS. IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing. You ready for another bout? He's not slowing down. Thor swings Mj�lnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK (looking up at Stark Tower) We're not finished yet. A beat."
6,avengers,NATASHA,"I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better. I thought General Soholob was in charge of the export business. You really think I'm pretty? LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open. Are you kidding? I'm working! I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything. Look, you can't pull me out of this right now. Let me put you on hold. She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her, Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider, she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by KICKBOXING him in the face. Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him. She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then Where's Barton now? But he's alive. Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me. Bozhe moi. You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. Then, what is it? Yoga? Just you and me. I did. Natasha Romanoff. No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD. We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent. Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in. I'll persuade you. You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak. Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe. This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet. She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner takes a closer look. Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be. Not that he's told me. Talk to Fury, he needs you on this. No one's gonna put you in a... Stand down. We're good here. Hi. There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? They're vintage, he's very proud. Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in hisway. Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath. Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly ""sail."" That's still not gonna find them in time. You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. Loki, drop the weapon and stand down. Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT. Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's tip on his helmet. The guy's all over the place. Suddenly, AC/DC's ""Shoot to Thrill"" overdrives the QUINJET'S speakers. Not a word. Where's this coming from? Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently. Another Asgardian? I'd sit this one out, Cap. These guys come from legends, they're basically gods. Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours. He killed eighty people in two days. But you figured I'd come. I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton. And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain. What happens to his mind? Love is for children. I owe him a debt. (she pulls up a chair as Not let you out. Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian... or was. It's really not that complicated. I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.  (turns back around; poised) So, Banner... that's your play.  You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor? Loki's manipulating you. You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you. (CONT'D) (quietly, to herself) I'm okay. We're okay, right? Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We're gonna be okay. Listen to me. Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there. We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on my life I will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never...  This is Agent Romanoff. I copy. Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton. Clint, you're gonna be alright. We don't have that long, it's gonna take time. You know that I do. Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head. Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for. Yeah. I don't suppose you know where? We gotta stop him. I don't know. Whoever's left. Now you sound like you. Natasha sits next to her partner and friend. He didn't, I just... I've been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I'd like to wipe it out. Go where?"
7,avengers,IRON MAN,"Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has. Make your move, Reindeer Games. Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes away. Good move. Captain. Now there's that guy. Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor. I have a plan. Attack. IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a parachute to follow. Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer! begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve. I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position. IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this! What's it look like in there? Well, you're not wrong. continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine engine. It's bad, but still fixable. laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS on it, relieving the rotors. On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades. CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING. CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing down at them. begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots. Yeah. Noticed. The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S BOOSTERS get more and more bright. On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto a LOOSE CABLE. continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS itself. arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS device, holding the Tesseract. Okay. IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed. And there's one other person you pissed off! His name was Phil. Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on his ass. What, did you stop for drive-thru? Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out for you. BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to crash. Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.  (V.O.) Thor is right. We gotta deal with these guys. (V.O.) Banner? Call it, Cap. Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS. IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building. Just try and keep them off the streets. I will roger that. IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left. . - Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of Jonah? FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth. IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him, holding out their rifles. (V.O.) How long? fights off as many CHITAURI SOLDIERS as he sustain. Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters! (V.O.) No, wait! catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The missile speeds on. IRON MAN grabs it from behind, gripping it tightly. With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course. Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight up into sky, towards the portal. You might as well. climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed, suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die. The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror."
0,dumb_and_dumber,LLOYD,"Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? I'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost. I couldn't help noticing the accent. You from Jersey? Austria? You're kidding. (mock-Australian accent) Well, g'day, mate. What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie. (CONT'D) (to self) Guess I won't be going Down Under tonight... This is 22. Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my way. Why you going to the airport? Flying somewhere? Well, I saw your luggage, then when I noticed the airline ticket, I put two and two together. (beat) So where you heading? Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear California's beautiful this time of year. Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another glance. (CONT'D) Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas. Uh, this isn't my real job, you know. It's only temporary. Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store. (smiling) I got worms. That's what we're gonna call it: I Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms. A lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. They're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids. Uh... well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate. And if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back. And best of all, worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year industry. I wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what I mean. (CONT'D) What's the matter? Little tense about the flight? It's really nothing to worry about, Mary. Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. You know, like in a head-on crash, or something. Good thinking. There's a lot of bad rivers out there. Keep it. It was my pleasure. (CONT'D) Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and pass out. You'll be there before you know it. (to car's driver) Drive around me, you pinhead! Damn! I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. Of course not. (beat) I quit. I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire me. Winners control their own destiny, Har. Big deal. That car's an old bomb anyway. That's forty-two in dog years. It's a love memento. The most beautiful woman alive. Her name was Mary. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved. She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life. End of story. DO you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else's private property? (beat) It's locked. (CONT'D) (WHISPERING to Harry) Friend or foe? Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little swindlers gave me Peanut Butter Praline. (cringing) That's a hostile pattern. I say we bail and get down to unemployment. Blew it? For your information, we only missed three days in two months. Give me what's left of our dough. I'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities. (CONT'D) What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night Train? Excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar? Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar? My wallet's locked in this machine. It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma Walton. She got my wallet, too. (CONT'D) Come on, man, cheer up. We've been own before. I'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere. HARRY It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet Petey he's... he's dead. Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What happened? His head fell off? (hopeful) I don't suppose he had a warranty...? That's it! I've had it with this ump! We don't have food, we don't have jobs, our pets' heads are falling off, we're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old No I won't calm down. (CONT'D) What the hell are we doing here anyway, Harry? We've got to get out of this town. HARRY Yeah, and go where? I'll tell you where: someplace warm, a place where the beer flows like wine, where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. (dramatic PAUSE) I'm talking about Aspen. That's right, Aspen. Let me ask you something: do you want to end up like Petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment, face- down on a Dear Abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? Or do you want to enjoy your life? (beat) Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's eath be in vain. Don't you see what he was saying? Spread your wings, man. he was saying? Spread your wings, man. Fly. That's bullshit. I'll drive. (beat) And what's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline? HARRY (torn) I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep saving money for the worm store. I'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors. You know what I'm sick and tired of, Harry? I'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. I'm sick and tired of being a nobody. (MORE) (CONT'D) (beat) But most of all, I'm sick and tired of having nobody. On the other hand, maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court. With all those lawsuits against us, I'm sure we'll win at least one. It could be a boost to our egos. & HARRY ""We've got to get out of this place, If it's the last thing we ever do, We've got to get out of this place, Girl, there's a better life, for me and you..."" Well, we're finally doing it. Do you realize that in all the years we've known each other, this is the first time we've done this together. Taken a trip. (CONT'D) Why'd you do that? Take your seatbelt off. Well what about the people who live around here? What if we got into an accident with one of them? Bought 'em when we filled up. This didn't come out of our travel fund. I was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left. You know, so we could live in style. I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C. That's right. Just some odds and ends. Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Well who else was I gonna sell it to? Put your mind at ease, friend. I took care of it. According to this map, about an inch and a half. And I believe I'm right, Harry. How much you wanna bet? What do you mean you don't bet? Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal that I can get you gambling before the day's out. I'll give you three-to-one odds. That's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose. Okay, five-to-one I can get you gambling before the day's out. Make it ten-to-one. Harry sticks out his hand. (to Waitress) (CONT'D) What's the soup du jour? Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.  Uh-oh... You spilled the salt. That's bad luck. We're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder. Because that's good luck. Or was it the left shoulder? Well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals... (brightening) Wait a second. I think I just had an idea. Follow me... (CONT'D) Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier. What I'm trying to say is, my friend and I would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the hatchet. Whatever you want, sir. I'll have the waitress send them over. Oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road. Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check. They said just add this to their tab. Well, if that guy at the table over there is Sea Bass... (to Cashier) By the way, how far is it to Rhode Island from here? I just wish we could've seen Sea Bass's face when he got the bill. Don't worry. That fish-head is probably half-way to Providence by now. Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a whiz. But I gotta go. What am I supposed to do? I can't hold it. I'm about to explode. Are you serious? Uh-oh... The bottle's almost full and I'm still going. I can't stop once I already started, you know that. Quick, get me another bottle. (CONT'D) Jesus, be careful! You almost went off the road. Here, hold this. Hey, I haven't gone all day. But, your honor, he's telling the truth. It's not beer. (under breath) YOU WOULD, TOO... 'S FANTASY: (v.o.) (v.o.) Nothing. Nothing at all. (v.o.) Hey, it's the only motel that charges by the hour. We can't afford anything else. Yep, this sure is the life. Cold beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink sheets... You know, there's only one thing that could make this moment any better. If you had a nice set of knockers. Right now I'd settle for one. What happened, Harry? Some little filly break your heart? Felcher? You mean the babe who worked for the tractor company? That's cold, Har. Give you any reason? You're it. You're it. Quitsies. Damn, you're good, Harry. (beat) Hey, didn't I tell you this trip would be a blast? See, I told you these country folks were friendly, Harry. Well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous Aspenese air. The freshest. They say on any day of the week you can smell a moose-fart ten miles away. Then we make a splash on the social scene. (CONT'D) Harry, look the golden arches. Pull over, I'm starving. CUT TO: Look, once we drop the briefcase off to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll plug us right into the party circuit. After that, we do a little of the ski Some bum down at unemployment. What's the matter? Yeah? So? (CONT'D) Hey, wait a second. Hold everything. Aren't you forgetting something? (CONT'D) Back at Mickey D's? A little matter you might've overlooked...? My change. It's a vegetable. And I happen to know it's a vegetable. Fine with me. Okay, Harry, my turn. Let 'er rip. (CONT'D) Hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet, aged to perfection will rip no fart before it's time. (beat) Come on, Marquis of Dingleberry's rules: you got ten seconds. All right. I'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog extra onions, garden salad with blue... Kit-Kat bar. Okay, you go first. No, you go first. Hmmm, not bad... Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you. Perhaps it's about time you brushed No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.' Hand me those peppers the atomic ones. More like re-location. Not really. I was just her limo river. Life is a fragile thing, Har. One minute you're chewing on a burger; the next minute you're dead meat. If you don't count that gurgling sound. (CONT'D) Hey, relax, man, I'm just as responsible as you are we both slipped him the peppers and look at me, I on't feel guilty at all. That's ridiculous. You probably won't live to see forty. Sorry, Har. We're gonna have to hold out. Seems we misjudged our expense allocation. If we pay for a motel we won't have enough for gas. We over-leveraged. The slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe and a chocolate malt. Drive. We've only got ten more hours. We can take turns. Um, yeah could you do it the other way around? Look, Harry, I told you what happened, now drop it. HARRY Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to mention another word about you being in a bathroom stall with a six-foot, five-inch trucker with his pants own. That's a low blow, man. Listen, bud, if you're trying to imply that I'm that thought look, we're almost in Colorado. Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky... (CONT'D) Boy, some guys just weren't cut out for life on the road. Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back. I'd say a good five hours, anyway. Should be. I've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night. Boy, I'll tell you, this is one angerous highway. You wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing I couldn't even recognize. I hit 'em. I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver's some full of shit, huh? (CONT'D) I must say, Des Moines sure is a pretty little town. Last night. We drove through it. (sing-song) Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and shine. (LAUGHS) You were the one who was asleep, In our country it does, yes. I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can make a mistake. (CONT'D) Come on, man, pull yourself together. (rolls his eyes) You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo. (CONT'D) Come on, stop being a baby about this. Okay, so we back-tracked a tad. Well it doesn't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it. If we're gonna get out of this hole, we're gonna have to dig ourselves out. Where you going? You can't be serious. (CALLING OUT) Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you never screwed up. Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his friend. He seems completely rained. Got room for one more, if you still want to go to Aspen. Used car dealer. I   traded the van for it. Plus I got   the guy to throw in fifty bucks for   gas money. (beat) Come on, man, what   do you say? We still partners? Tell me something, Harry. Would you really have kept going home if I hadn't come back to get you? We were never Cub Scouts. Relax, it's empty. Isn't this wonderful? What more could a couple of single guys like us ask for? You're so materialistic. (beat) Why don't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to Mary. Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two? Um... good question. Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I caught that either. (brightening) Come to think of it, there is. It's engraved right into the leather. Samsonite   spelled just like it sounds. A little. Shall we share it? Mmmm mmmm good... Hmmm... looks like an old piece of Beef Jerky. You're pathetic. Get your own. Roll up your window. Then I guess the damn anti-cold system isn't working. You really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter. Right here the A/C button. I put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder. (CONT'D) What are you going out there for? What are you worrying about now? Huh? (CONT'D) Harry, calm down! You're acting like a wild animal! Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine. I'm a Christian Scientist! (CONT'D) What are you doing? Don't do anything foolish, Harry. You're making a big mistake, Harry! I'll never forgive you for this! (CONT'D) Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get better, I promise! In fact, I think No I'm not, man look. (CHOKED VOICE) Harry, look! Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel. And we'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs. That way, whatever we borrow we can pay back. You know, as soon as we get jobs. Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our own chicks. Tell you what you can send up, my friend how about some chow? Don't bother. Just order us one of everything. Oh, sorry. (beat) Make that two of everything. Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in Barnard's top pocket. (CONT'D) And here you go, Barney. You keep us happy, we'll keep you happy. (proudly) Our first IOU. Signed and dated. It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked the big time. What's the big deal? We're gonna pay it all back anyway, right? Surfboards? I thought those were beginner's skis. This suddenly makes sense to Harry. Where'd this come from? What for? Harry, how many women do you know who wear a size XXL? Enter, parlez vous! All out of Boone's Farm, huh? BARNARD You have a rapier wit, sir. I took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute: Dom Perignon. Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh? Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it, Barney, we're all from the     same mold. (winks) We just have a little more     dough than you right now. (dumbstruck) Harry, it's her. Mary with the briefcase. This is her... (CONT'D) Mary Swanson... Thanks for the lift, Barney. This should cover a couple plates. I'm getting nervous, Harry. What are you talking about? They're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated. Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't like me? (to BARTENDER) Two martinis, straight up. As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away. (CONT'D) Shut up, Harry. Yeah, well I know what you were gonna say and I'm telling you to shut up in advance. I read you like a book. You were gonna say: (in Harry's looped VOICE) 'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in.' (CONT'D) And I would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like Ron Jeremy on Spanish Fly. Two more, please. I can't help it. This is a very important night for me. (MORE) (CONT'D) (beat) Harry, have you ever wondered why you and I never have long-term girlfriends? That was a fluke. (beat) The reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing: We're afraid of the C word. I'm talking bout commitment. Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry. The first time I laid eyes on Mary Swanson, I knew she was the one. (beat) Some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. This girl makes me feel it all in the heart. (CONT'D) Oh shit, there she is. She's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far I came just to see her. And then what? She'll take it back and that'll be it. I'm a nobody. (brightening) Wait a second, I have an idea. You go over and introduce yourself. That way you can build me up so when I come along I won't have to brag about myself. Tell her I'm good-looking and I'm rich and I have a rapist's wit. Please Harry, I'm appealing to you as one loser to another. Just build me up and then give me a signal to come over. Please. How come you didn't call me over? Wha... you... I... it's... (smiles) I love you, man. I love you! This calls for a toast! (CONT'D) You're gonna be my best man, Har, I mean it. It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal. Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs. Mary Christmas. You Impossible. I know my type    when I see it. Now let me get this    straight, she wants me to meet her at    the Avalanche Bar and Grill on    Main Street? Time out. Where are going ressed like that. You mean you're gonna go out in public dressed in tights? But you can see the outline of your who-who. Turn sideways. (CONT'D) Actually, it's just a tiny little lump. No one will ever notice. I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait at the bar? Maybe some other time. (CONT'D) Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to know a Mary Swanson, would you? Do you know where she lives? Some best man. Believe me, it was the right place. (SIGHS) I don't know, Har, maybe she just had second thoughts. What? (brightening) Do ya think...? (shrugging) I just figured she was a raging alcoholic. I knew there was an explanation. And here I thought she was standing me up. Will you join me in a good luck toast before you head out? Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't you? I see. (CONT'D) To my friend Harry the matchmaker. Hi. (beat) Don't you remember me? South Bend. I drove you to the airport last week. You remembered. I brought you your briefcase You left it at the airport so I picked it up for you. Yeah, it's back at my hotel room. Come on, let's take a ride. I'll give it to you. ..So anyway, as soon as I got to town I tried to look you up but I idn't know your last name. 'Course I have it. When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman to the airport, he makes sure she gets all her luggage, no matter what he has to Well... no... I mean, you know, there were other reasons... (beat) Actually, yeah, I guess I did. Look, Mary, I know this may seem a little sudden but I've given it a lot of thought: You're the woman I've been waiting for my whole life, and I'm not ashamed to admit it -- (holds up his hand) --Please, let me finish. (DEEP BREATH) I'm crazy about you. I've never felt this way about anyone. You make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires. (NERVOUS LAUGH) Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy again. (beat) A schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet, sweet love to you. Mary... (BLURTING OUT) I desperately want to make love to a schoolboy. No, that's not what Imeant. I meant... I really like you, Mary. I like you a lot. (CONT'D) I'm gonna ask you something flat out and I want you to answer me honestly: What do you think the chances are of a girl like you and a guy like me ending up together? --I asked you to be honest, Mary. MARY But Lloyd, I really can't -- --Come    on, give it to me straight. I rove a    long way to see you, the least you can    do is level with me. What are my    chances? You mean not good, like one out of a hundred? (Duh) So you're telling me there's a chance? Husband? Who are you? Uh-oh. Uh, sir, about the briefcase, I want you to know, my friend Harry and I have every intention of reimbursing you. That's as good as money, sir. Those are our IOUs. You can add them up yourself. Every penny's accounted for. Now don't do anything hasty, man. (cutting) Yeah, we used to be best friends. Me a backstabber? You got a lot of nerve. I saw her first. But you knew how crazy I was about her. (waning righteousness) What are you talking about? You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were. I mean, if one beautiful girl   could rip us apart like this, then   it seems our friendship isn't worth a   damn. (beat) Maybe we should call it quits   right here. Mary's married, Harry. No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the one who got you into this mess. Jesus Christ! You killed my best friend, you bastard! Harry! You're alive! (dumbstruck) You gotta be kidding. (to Athletic Beauty) But how did you...? She's something, ain't she, Har? HARRY You were right, Lloyd. She was efinitely worth the trip. Guess we have to admit it, she was too good for us. Look, we just wanted to say that we appreciate all you did for us during our stay. Well, anyway, thanks again for everything. This joint is a little out of our budget, Barney. You know what, Barney, I think we'll take out chances down the road. (v.o.) I say we head due south and try a little nose-rubbing with some of them slinky eskimo babes."
1,dumb_and_dumber,HARRY,"Okay, gang, single file. You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies... The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell. You kids stay right here... (CONT'D) (at truck) Hey, wait a minute! I got fired again. None taken. Were you shitcanned, too? Why'd you quit? Why didn't you wait and see if your suspicions were well-founded? You know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that I just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle. (beat) The alarm alone cost me two hundred. What are you talking about? It's only six years old. What's with the briefcase? Huh? What's in it? Why not? 'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental are standing at the door. (WHISPERING) We don't have any friends. (CONT'D) Can't recognize them. Could be student loan thugs again, or the IRS, or maybe somebody pissed off about that case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced a check on. Well, whoever they are, they look serious. One of them's even wearing plaid. Yeah, and that was because of a blizzard Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find something else for us. How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline? Get Robitussin it's a better buzz. Where's the booze? His head fell off. Yeah, he was pretty old. Nah, I bought him used. Okay, calm down. Aspen? I don't know, Lloyd, the French are assholes. (confused) What are you talking about, Lloyd? His head fell off. (dawning realization) Wait a second, I know what you're up to. You just wanna go to Aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there. Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss. (emotional) Petey, I made a promise to you once, man... (thinking hard) ...and I'll be damned if I can remember what it was. Been run out of town? What? Because we just cleared the danger zone. LLOYD Huh? Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. We've already traveled 6.3 miles. Where'd you get those? Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures. We're on a tight budget, remember? Where'd you get twenty-five extra bucks? You mean the blind kid? What did you sell him, Lloyd? Specifically? But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a head. How far have we gone? Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there. We don't have enough gas money. LLOYD Relax. We have more than enough. I believe you're wrong, Lloyd. I still say wrong, Lloyd. I don't bet. I mean I don't gamble, you know that. Never have and never will. There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do it. You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I already told you, I don't gamble. Sorry, pal, no way. You got yourself a bet, sucker! Actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well. Could you please bring me a spoon? What's the matter? What for? It was a terrible accident, Sir. Believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size. Please accept my most sincere apology. Um... the thought had crossed my mind. Nah, you go ahead. Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I still haven't eaten. Lloyd, what are you doing? You know we can't afford to buy them drinks. Oh, and put these on there, too. I hope we never have to. I hope so. Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now. What if they figure out we went the other way. They'll be on us in no time. Hold it. Well... just take a whiz in an empty beer bottle. There's a couple on the floor in the back seat. Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping now. We could get killed. Lloyd SIGHS. He takes an EMPTY BEER BOTTLE from the back seat and UNZIPS his fly. Suddenly we hear a PEEING SOUND. Then: What's the matter? Well stop going. I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best I can. What are you, a goddamn camel? Huh? (calling out) No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for noticing! (CONT'D) Jesus, what is this, the fashion police? Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty in the car. No, sir. Oh, that's nothing, sir. Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you. (v.o.) I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little sleazy staying here when we're not even engaged. What's that? That's two things, Lloyd. I don't know, Lloyd, these places just don't do it for me. Brings back too many memories. Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher. We stayed at a place like this once No-Tell Motel out on Route 31. The same. We had this incredibly romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd be together forever. (SIGHS) Then about a week later, right out of the blue, she sends me a John Deere letter. I called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that. I wasn't really paying attention. (CONT'D) Thing that really hurts is I think she was seeing another guy. Never id find out who. You're it. (tapping him back) Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies. No anti-quitsies. No startsies. Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd: what exactly do we do when we get to Aspen? Fresh, huh? (sincere) Wow... talk about paradise. (beat) And after we're finished breathing, what next, Lloyd? Thanks. About this social scene how do you expect a couple mutts like us to make a splash in the land of pedigrees when we don't even have any money? I don't know, Lloyd. Money does terrible things to people. I mean, we could lose our friendship. What? What? I think this guy's in trouble. Why on't you pull over. It's a fruit. I'm telling you, it's a fruit. Tell you what, why don't we leet an impartial judge decide. Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet: Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables? And...? You're the best, man. (beat) Okay, my turn. LLOYD Where are your manners, Harry? We have a guest. Come on, Mr. Mentalino. Let one fly. It's only a buck. I'll do one if you will. No, you go first. Yeah, more tingly than hot. That really wasn't very polite of him, was it? Maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair. (humbled) You mean like 'turn the other cheek?' (whispering) Here he comes. The briefcase isn't even ours. Some lady just left it at the airport. We're bringing it back to her. Hey, you okay, man? It was just a goof. I can't believe it... But he blamed me. You heard him. Those were his last words. Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids. (SIGHS) Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a ead guy pissed at me. His restless spirit will probably haunt me for the next seventy-five years. Let's get off and crash at a motel before I crash into one. (yawning) I need a crib fast. What happened to the dough? On what? LLOYD I sprung for Mr. Chili Pepper's last meal. Felt it was the least we could o after we deep-sixed him. Wait a second one burger put us over budget? Oh. (beat) So what are we gonna do? Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump. Skis, huh? Great. (CONT'D) They yours? Both of 'em? (impressed) Cool. (re: suitcases in back seat) That's a lot of luggage for a little vacation. (holding out mirror) Here, this is a little loose. (CONT'D) Allow me... (CONT'D) Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen we can meet up... you know, for hot chocolate or something. (urgently) Look, why don't you just tell it to me, I've got a good memory. (desperate) Positive please hurry. You've got some serious explaining to o, young man. Not at that height it's not. I think it's about   time we pull over and change seats.   I've been driving for nine straight   hours I  don't have the energy to   start a new state. (groggy) How long have I been out? Great. We must be getting real close, huh? Good man. That's awful. Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there? Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this. Yeah, it really is. (beat) Wait a minute when did you visit Des Moines? What are you talking about? You were snoring like a baby when we went through Des Moines. Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't the sun rise in the east and set in the west? Then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at 7:30 in the morning when we're heading west. You know, I got half a mind to just jump on the bus to Europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever. Oh yeah? Why not? LLOYD You don't have a passport. A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction. Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen, we on't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough to eat, we don't have enough to sleep! You know, you're absolutely right, Lloyd. Home. I'm walking home. (sarcastic) Why not? We're probably only five miles away. Look, man... I'm sorry. (beat) I never should have let you talk me into this in the first place. You've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl's waiting for you. But let's face it, Lloyd, there's nothing waiting for me in Aspen. (beat) There's nothing waiting for me anywhere. Where'd you find this baby? Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember that? Exactly. (CONT'D) What the hell is this? There's a coffin in the back! I don't give a shit. I'm not driving anywhere with a casket. You know I'm superstitious calm down. We'll dump it off first chance we get. How about food and shelter? Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes the lovely young lady reside? Well what's her last name? We'll look it up in the phone book. What is it? Any soup left? Please. Hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth. Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it. Wanna split it? I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd. It is rolled up. What anti-cold system? To warm up. I'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling I'm about to give you. Get over here and take your medicine, Lloyd! Something I should've done a long time ago. This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along. Foolish? This is the most sensible thing I've done in years. I'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river. Lloyd starts to follow after Harry. You're bluffing. That's a filling, you liar! (CONT'D) I used to have a life! A miserable one, but a life, nonetheless! Sounds good. We'll be meticulous    right down to the last penny. Absolutely. We're good for it. It'll come right out of our first paycheck. Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up. What are their names? One of everything? Lloyd... Oh god, it's really true. Last night I thought I might've been dreaming. And it was so simple. All it took was somebody else's money. (CONT'D) You know, Lloyd, I think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today. Sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards? Ahhh. I was wondering why you had those bindings put on them. (sheepishly) I bought it. I like the feel of it against my skin... (defensive) ...I mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it. Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now. I'm supposed to have a few eccentricities. Cocktail hour has commenced! (CONT'D) Hey, later on what do you say we...? (CONT'D) Lloyd... you okay? Who? Come on, Cinderella, it's time to get you ready for the ball... I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if we want seconds? relax, Lloyd. These people are just like you and me. So what? We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound. Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. A little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence. I didn't say anything. How do you know what I was gonna say? Okay, if you read me like a book then what was I gonna say? Lloyd, I've never seen you this uptight. You've gotta chill out. What are you talking about? I went out with Fraida Felcher for two and a half weeks. That's crazy. We live for the C word. (beat) Oh. (checking her out) Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd. She's an angel. (beat) Well, what are you waiting for? Get over there and talk to her. You have her briefcase she's gonna be thrilled to see you. Look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl. Don't quit on the last fifty feet. I can't tell her you're good looking, Lloyd she's got eyes. All right. But you're gonna owe me a big one for this. (CONT'D) Nice set of hooters you got there. The owls. They're beautiful. Well, I used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines that's dogs to the layperson. Oh, I've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; I've even bred them. Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But one time we successfully mated a Bulldog and a Shitzu. Yeah. We called it a Bullshit. (breaks out LAUGHING) Just a little breeder joke. (CONT'D) Anyway, the real reason I came over is because I want to introduce you to a friend of mine. Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you both. (taken aback) You were? Really? (CONT'D) Anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because I believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. Whuh? Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball. (CONT'D) Um... well... I don't know. You see, the thing is... sure. Relax, you're golden. I got you a ate with her tomorrow. Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene. (under breath) I think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd. Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you think you may be jumping the gun a little? I mean, who knows, when you get to know her, you may find out she's not your type. That's what she said. Ten o'clock sharp. I, uh, thought while you were making your love connection I'd try my luck on the slopes. These aren't tights. They're fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers. Really? You're right. I can't go out dressed like this. Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving a clutch with these things. (CALLING OUT) You take the first run alone. I'm gonna loosen up down here. Glorious. Why not? Thanks. (CONT'D) Oh, look... frost. (lisping) Sure. I do this all the time... CUT TO: (lisping) See ya at the bottom... (lisping) Hi. (off their looks) Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to have a cup of warm water, would you? (lisping) I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off. My pleasure, Mary. Better make it quarter to eight. I've got a few things to take care of first. (CONT'D) (to himself) Mary Dunne... Mrs. Mary Dunne... Got a nice ring to it. I have a hard time believing that, Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't wait to see you again. (CONT'D) Wait a minute... It just occurred to me. She must've meant ten o'clock at night. Of course! Why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the morning? Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties? That'll teach you to jump to conclusions. (beat) Anyway, since you have your night all (o.s.) Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think will help your chances. Uh... it's for mature audiences. I on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door. Huh? Um, no, I was just... shaving. (o.s.) Yeah! I was running a little late. Thought this would save time. (under breath) Come on, flush, you bastard... Uh... just cleaning my teeth. Give me a minute, Mary, I'll be right with you. But Mary -- (MUMBLING to himself) It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw your best friend over and it's gonna come back to haunt you, plain and simple... You...? What are you doing here? Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta talk, man. I have a serious confession to make. (CONT'D) Oh good, you found her. I'll just leave you two kids alone. Until he turned into a backstabber. Hey, I couldn't help it if she found me irresistable. Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't stop you, did it? Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me the whole sordid story. Well I guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we? Guess not. Just tell me where to sign, bud. I wouldn't pull that trigger if I were you. (smug) Except you're forgetting one minor etail. If you kill us, you'd be killing yourself. You see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. In other words, I am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened Husband? What husband? Kill her. The bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. It would've saved us a lot of trouble. No, wait, do me first. I'm the one who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve it. She grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up. They slapped this on me and gave me a gun. Yeah, about that dough... Hey, Barney... And we're, um, sorry about the money we gave you turning out to be phony. BELL CAPTAIN Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The Swanson family has promised to reimburse everyone. I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer camp somewhere to call home. Are you on the level? (v.o.) Since we're finished elbow-rubbing, what next, lloyd? (v.o.) Now you're talking my language. You know I got a weakness for blondes."
7,dumb_and_dumber,MARY,"Hello. (beat) I'll be just a minute... (dead-pan) How'd you guess? Aspen. I'm Mary. Oh? That's nice. I beg your pardon? Aren't ants quiet, too? I see. (beat) Something like that. Um, Lloyd, could please keep your eyes on the road. Here you go. Thanks Lloyd. (beat) And good luck with your worms. (v.o.) How does that feel, Lloyd? (o.s.) How's the other side? (o.s.) Lloyd, will you wash my nipples...? It just doesn't make any sense. I left the money exactly where they instructed me to. But I'd never forgive myself if something happened to Melvin. Thank you, Daddy. (o.s.) Thank you. (CONT'D) Yech! What's in this, whiskey? Just knowing that Melvin's out there, being held by God knows who... (fighting back tears) It's all my fault. I should've been there. Maybe we should just pay them the money again and get this thing over What am I supposed to do? Go about my life as if everything were fine? I beg your pardon? Oh. Yeah. (beat) Are you a bird lover? Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how Really? Any unusual breeding? Really? That's weird. Actually, we haven't been introduced yet. (holds out hand) I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my stepmother, Helen. Helen, you're embarrassing me. Beautiful day, huh, Harry? God, it feels so good to get up here. I haven't been outdoors much in the last couple of weeks. (evasive) There's been... family problems. I on't want to bore you with them. Are you okay? 'S POV - HARRY IS SITTING AT A TABLE, STILL ATTACHED TO THE CHAIR LIFT (WHICH My god. Harry, are you okay? This is silly. Let me help you...

Why don't you stay and join the party? ..I want a one-way ticket to Rio De Janerio departing as soon as possible... Okay, which one of you losers wants to die first? Why not?

Price is the most wired. I'm the  best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a  bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten  keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . Or can it be worn with a suit? With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or  charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder  vest. Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out? That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there. Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with  anything? You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah.  You spin a dreidel. No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks. Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all  this? I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a  virus. Maybe it's just the light. What? It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do  enough of it we'll be okay. Calm down. Let's do it anyway That's the spirit. (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks. (V.0.)  My name is Patrick Bateman. I am  twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden  Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh  floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse. (V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a  balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the  morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice  pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand  now. (V.O.)  After I remove the icepack, I use a deep  pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a  water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body  scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. (V.O.)  Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which  I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my  routine. (V.O.) I always use an after-shave lotion with little  or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes  you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye  balm, followed by a final moisturizing ""protective"" lotion... (V.O.)  There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some  kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an  entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold  gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you  and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably  comparable: I simply am not there. (V.O.)  It is hard for me to make sense on any given  level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality  is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is  persistent. (V.0.)  My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared  a long time ago, if they ever did exist. Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages? I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.  Anyone else? When? Negative. Cancel it. Just...say...no. Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols  at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All  right? Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight  tonight. No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks. No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay? Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that  outfit again. I said ""Do not wear that outfit again."" Wear a  dress. A skirt or something. Come on, you're prettier than that. I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels. (V.O.)  I'm trying to listen to the new George  Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fianc�e-keeps buzzing  in my ear. (Removing his Walkman)  Do...what. Evelyn? Is your Evian spiked? No-I can't take the time off work. I don't want to talk about it. Because I...want...to...fit...in. (V.O.)  I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace  since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do,  and relief washes over me in an awesome wave. (After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and  checking his hair)  Hi. Pat Bateman. Let me guess-you live in the East Village? (V.O.) I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn  are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s  usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight  I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use,  though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers,  the biggest dufus in the business. Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important  problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign  policy is important, but there are more pressing problems  at hand. Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow  down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world  hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We  have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We  have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and  oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while  also promoting equal rights for women but change the  abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still  somehow maintain women's freedom of choice. We also have to control the influx of illegal  immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional  moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in  movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have  to promote general social concern and less materialism in  young people. Why don t you just go for Price? He's rich. He's good-looking. He has a great body No. I'm not. Why should I ? It's not. Hello. Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait... you're not giving me valid reasons. What are you trying to say to me? Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee?  Bleach-ee. Oh my God. (Talking over her)  Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question.  Two. (Louder)  Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very  expensive sheets and I really need them clean. If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill  you, are you understanding me? Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting  (Checks Rolex)  at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those  ...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at  Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need  those sheets cleaned by this afternoon. This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with  this. Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ! Hello  (Mumbles un incomprehensible name) Well. Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk  to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere. Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You  know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup? Listen, if you could talk to them  (He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand)  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a  lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes. Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank  you, uh... Victoria? Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the  time. (Checking his watch)  Next Saturday? Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin�e of Les Miserables.  Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call  you. Listen, what are you doing tonight? Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me,  and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to  tonight? On a lot of lithium? You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY  But-when? Am I confused or were we talking about tonight? Pumpkin? Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New  York. Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling  dickweed. Courtney? Dinner? I'm thinking Dorsia. Nice? The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will  you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a  boyfriend to eat there tonight. Eight? Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear  something fabulous. Dorsia, remember? (Both of his eyes are closed)  Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to  reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps? Is that Donald Trump's car? You know, Courtney, you should take some more  lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you  out of this slump. J&B. Straight. Yes. (Examining a menu that says ""Barcadia"" in large script)  Yes, dear. Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter  soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine  called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" You'll  love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and  pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him. Is it a what? I'm ignoring you. (Slowing down but not stopping) What do you want, Courtney? It's a plain end. I think. Oh Jesus. I'm going home. It's a plain end, see? So? Why? Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see,  Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  (He slaps her again lightly)  Why is it pulled down half an inch?  So it can catch the force of the ejaculate! See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch? Lucky, I guess. Uh huh. (Catching Luis hand)  Your compliment was sufficient Luis. I've been great. And you? (V.O.)  Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam.  It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in  fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a  penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.  Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have  a slightly better haircut. (Nervous)  It's...it's...all right. Oh well, you know. Oh yes. I'm very lucky. New card. What do you think? Picked them up from the printers yesterday That's bone. And the lettering is something called  Silian Rail. (Barely able to breath, his voice a croak)  Nice. (V.O.) I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine. (Choking with anxiety)  Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card. (V.O.)  Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness  of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark... (Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman. You want some money?. Some...food? Is this what you need? It's cold out, too, isn't it? (Holding the bill just out of the man's reach)  Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you  get a job? Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it?  Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on  the job? Gee, uh, that's too bad. Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job? You're not what? Qualified for anything else? I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record.  I'm trying to help you. Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who  do have jobs? From people who do work? Listen, what's your name? Speak up. Come on. Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude.  That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together.  I'll help you. (Petting the dog)  Shhhh...it's okay. (Stroking his face, whispering)  Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God. You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  (Shouting) Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of  faggot. Al...I'm sorry. It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common  with you. Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are? There's a quarter. Go buy some gum. (V.O.)  I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood,  skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except  for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside  me and I don't know why. (V.O.)  My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal,  on the verge of frenzy. (V.O.)  I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight? J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer. Not if you want to keep your spleen. Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous  here. Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  (Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood)  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello. Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez  Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana  be at Texarkana? So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the  Fisher account? How did you get it? I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane? Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think  she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams. Another Martini, Paul? (Talking to Owen like a child)  Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check. Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave  a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap? Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  (Helping him into his jacket)  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a  bottle of Absolut waiting for us. You like Huey Lewis and the News? (Said partly from the bathroom)  The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of  consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall.  He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen  from behind ail the time. He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think  Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. Yes, Owen? No, Owen. Yes, it is. In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most  accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is  ""HiP To Be Square,"" a song so catchy that most people probably  don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not  just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of  trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself. crosses the room and picks up the ax. Hey, Paul? (Raising the ax and screaming)  Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking  stupid bastard! (Panting)  Fucking bastard... drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby,  past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment. is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his  feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him. No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken. Commes des Garcon. Jesus lives, Luis. Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans? Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London. Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London  for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.  Hasta la vista, baby. (Faintly irritable)  What is it? (Condescendingly)  Ye-es, Je-an? Who? Tell him I'm at lunch. Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless  phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end. Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion  to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good  buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt  calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties... (Realizing that Kimball is staring at him)  Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent. Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just  walked in... (He laughs inanely)  Just joking... (Pause)  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John,  right, got it.  (He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)  Sorry about that. Oh that? Just mulling over business problems.  Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip. (Shaking firmly)  Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you. (Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)  So, what's the topic of discussion? You're not with the FBI or anything, are you? Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes. Coffee? Perrier? San Pellegrino? Can you bring Mr... Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle- It's no problem Well, what's the topic of discussion? Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the  disappearance or anything... (Trying to laugh)  Not on ""Page Six"" at least. Understandable.  (Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino)  Lime? You sure? I can always get you a lime. Shoot. Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October. Harvard. The Harvard Business School. Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building. (Flattered)  Thanks. Who do you ask? Nuprin? Bad habit. No, I guess it's okay. No problem.  (Buzzing Jean) Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence. Well... I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing,  you know. Yeah...Yale thing. Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet  homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing. He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet. I hope I'm not being cross-examined here. No. Not really. Hang...out? Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular  places. No, he just hung out there. Don't you know this? We were both seven in 1969. Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints? Well, maybe he did, huh? But...has anyone seen him in London? Hmmm. Oh. What? Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced  diet and- Have you consulted a psychic? Had his apartment been burglarized? I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet  or anything, right? That's so typical, isn't it? Nothing. The earth just opens up and swallows people.  (He checks his Rolex) (Standing up)  You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting  with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes. Uh, no. There's one...down here. Yes. It's very good. Absolutely, I'm 100% with you. You like that, slut? You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar  boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white  cotton T-shirt by  Commes des Garcons.  (He snorts like a pig)  My Rolex cost- (Whipering)  I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do  you think of that?  (Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts)  Huh, bitch? I haven't seen you around here. Would you like to see my apartment? Do you want to come to my apartment or not? Do you take American Express? Do you take American Express? I'm joking. Come on, get in. I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does  couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the  American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really  can't stress blonde enough. Blonde. That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking. I want you to clean your vagina. No. From behind. Get on your knees. I want to watch. You have a very nice body. Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry  off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and  our guest in the living room for drinks. You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat.  I'm Paul. How good of you to come. Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm  going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen. So, don't you want to know what I do? Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce.  (Long pause)  Have you heard of it? Actually, that's none of your business, Christie,  hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap. No, no smoking. Not in here. Varda truffle? I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very  fine Chardonnay you're not drinking. Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis  fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before  that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too  artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins'  presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out  another one. I think ""Invisible Touch"" is the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the  same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding  three albums. Christie, take off the robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,  Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance  of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer  songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.  Sabrina, why don't you dance a little? Take the lyrics to ""Land of Confusion."" In this  song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political  authority. ""In Too Deep"" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about  monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting.  Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything  I've heard in rock. Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your  asshole. Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and  therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially  songs like ""In the Air Tonight"" and ""Against  All Odds."" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. But I also think that Phill Collins works better  within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and  I stress the word artist. This is ""Sussudio,"" a great,  great song, a personal favorite. Don't touch the Rolex. We're not through yet... What an asshole. I know her. I knew her. How did you guess? Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy  personality. Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if  they have a good personality?  (He smiles giving up)  I know, I know- Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was  an interesting guy. He said, ""When I see a pretty girl walking down the  street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her  out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat  her right."" What her head would look like on a stick. (Suddenly angry)  Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? ""What about  fucking dinner?"" (Watching Luis going into the men's room)  Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump. Excuse me. (Hissing)  What...is...it? (Stumbling away from him)  I've gotta...I've  gotta...return some videotapes. What? CARRUTHERS  (Silently mouthing the words)  I'll call you. Maybe. Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe. You and...Luis? I never knew you smoked. You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're  going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less. Yes, Courtney? (Flatly)  You too. Yes? Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL  Kimball.  (Extending his hand)  Call me Don. Don. Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You  know. How's the investigation going? Taken anyone  in for ""formal questioning?"" (He makes quotation marks  in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh) Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump. Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need  anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean  Owen was a...complex man. (Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man! I mean-Mon. We be jammin'... (To Daisy)  Ask me a question. What do you think I do? No. Flattering, but no. I m into, well, murders and executions mostly. Welt...it depends, why? So, where do you work out? Leaving what? Don't, I'll drink it. Where to? Are you going to go get a gram? Don't tell me...merchant banking? (laughing)  Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What? Price! Come back! Oh really? DAISY  He said... (She laughs)  He said you gave him bad vibes. That's...that's too bad. What? (insincerely) No. I really don't. doesn't respond. We see that every space on the  puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean  drops the folder on his desk and then walks out. Jean? Would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is...if you're not doing anything. (Lowering his Wayfarers)  Well, isn't this a coincidence. Listen, where should we go? Let's not think about what I want. How about  anywhere you want. No, come on. Anywhere you want. Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere. Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go... Dorsia is...fine. Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at  nine o'clock? Oh really? That's great. Two at nine? Perfect. See you then. Yes? You're dressed...okay. They know me. Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock  for drinks, okay? And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out. Jean? Sorbet? I'm on a diet. But thank you. (Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness)  You can always he thinner. Look...better. No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling  it anyway. So listen, what do you really want to do with your  life? And don't tell me you enjoy working with children,  okay? Do you have a boyfriend? Interesting. Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very  Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape,  twine and a nail gun. Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life? Growing. I'm glad you said that. Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie,  was named Lassie? Had you heard this? Forget it. Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the  nail gun. (Looking up from loading nails into the gun)  What...No! Put it in the carton. Jean? What? I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just  want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special. Yes. I don t think I can...control myself. If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I  think I might hurt you.  (Almost hopefully)  You don't want to get hurt, do you? Thanks. It slipped my mind completely. Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come  into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda? Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  (Hopefully)  Is he a suspect? God...I guess...I was probably returning  videotapes. I had a date with a girl named Veronica. What? Well...I...Wait...What information have  you received? Well, I could he wrong. (Clearly nervous and under pressure)  We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It  was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner  at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I  physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't  remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's. Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long  day-a bit scattered. Great, yes, I'd like that. Absolutely. I'm with you on that one. Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers. No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me. I'll be there. Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise. Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. Nothing like last time, promise. (Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)  So, you're looking great, how have you been? (Mock shock)  Really? Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here. Bitch. Uh uh uh. Half now, half later. Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine,  Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.  You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything  about yourself. Is that clear. Christie? (Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment)  It's not that nice. What do you mean, she was a hot number. She's my...cousin. She's from...France. Elizabeth, it's three in the morning. Don't tell him you're here. (Whispering)  You're at Paul Owen s. (Whispering)  Paul Owen. No. Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.  What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free. Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive? Come on. I think it would be a turn-on. Christie, you're not drinking your wine. (To Elizabeth)  Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl? Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP  called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles  on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps  across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's  mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album  on a first listening. (Ignoring her)  It's hard to choose a favorite track  among so many great ones, but ""The Greatest Love of All""  is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about  self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message  crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope  that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder.  Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in  to empathize with others, we can always empathize with  ourselves. It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's  beautifully stated on the album. Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you  piece of bitch trash! I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch. (Speaking very carefully, measuring each word)  My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale  cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill  my needs. We need to talk. It's over, Evelyn. It's all over I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This  is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore. (Brushing her hand away)  I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about  that. You can have them. Yes, I am. We never really shared one. I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  (He pauses, as if searching for the right words)  You're just not terribly important to me. I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes. (Looking uncomfortably around the room)  If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making  this scene right now. I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going. I'm just leaving. I have to return some videotapes. Here kitty, kitty. Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my  lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of  people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some  homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in  Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin'  Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail  gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I  killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost  got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I  can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed  Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving  in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything  out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes  of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even... well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little.  Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not  sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess  I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show  up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open. Not in the mood, I guess. (Deliberately nonchalant)  Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them. I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some  sorbet? But how? Where do you place Paul that night? And? Marcus? But Marcus denied it? Well, does Marcus have an alibi? He does? You're sure? Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?  (He laughs) (Laughing with him)  Where was Marcus? So who was he with? Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen  to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner  with Victoria...the following night. 20B. Mrs. Wolfe? No. I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place. Doesn't he live here? Are you sure? No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here? But I think...I want to know what happened  here. I won't...don't worry. Jean? Hello? Jean? Hello? Jean, I need help! Jean-I'm not- Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch? What are I doing? I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean. ...to the office this afternoon. (Screaming)  Just...say...no! Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus! (On automatic)  I'm not going anywhere unless we  have a reservation. (He downs his drink)  Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously. Shut up, Carnes, they will not. So, Harold, did you get my message? (Waving smoke out of his face)  Yes, naturally. What exactly do you mean? But wait, Harold, what do you mean? Carnes? Wait. What are you talking about? Bateman is what? (Desperate, shouting)  Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really  comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes.  I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off.  I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your  machine was true. No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm  Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time!  Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer. Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed  Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible? Why not, you stupid bastard? No, you...didn't? I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  (To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal.  Working for UNICEF now? (V.O.)  But inside doesn't matter... Whatever. (V.O.) There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with  the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil,  all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward  it, I have now surpassed... (V.O.) My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better  world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on  others. I want no escape. (V.O.) But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no  deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted  from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any  of this. This confession has meant nothing..."
3,american-psycho,KIMBALL,"nods understandingly. No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  (Gesturing toward the phone)  Was that anything important? (Holding out his hand)  Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed  to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well,  you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get. stares at the three open copies of Sports  Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk.  Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines  into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is  still running. I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate  the disappearance of Paul Owen. Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator. So it's nothing that official. I just have some  basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself- No. I'm okay. No, I'm okay. takes out a small black notepad and the same gold  Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes  Jean. KIMBALL. Oh no, I'm okay. The disappearance of Paul Owen. I think his family wants this kept quiet. No, really. I'm okay. Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own  files, okay? How old are you? (Scribbling in his notebook)  Where did you go to school? Your address? (Looking up, impressed)  Nice. Very nice. Pardon me, but are you okay? You seem...nervous. I know. I'm sorry. Would you rather I not smoke? You sure? What can you tell me about Paul Owen? How well did you know him? Yale thing? What do you mean...Yale thing? So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul  Owen? What kind of man was he? Besides... (He hesitates tries to smile)  the information you've just given. Do you feel that way? (As he writes without looking up)  Where did Paul hang out? Yeah. You know...hang out. He had a yacht? And where did he go to school? I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN  Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help. I understand. Anything else you can tell me about Owen? (Smiles)  So was I. Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he  went to London. His girlfriend doesn't think so. Actually, yes. Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification.  A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but  I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert  Ainsworth for Paul, so... Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship? I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I  know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't  know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was  recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano  girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts- Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing. No. No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A  suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it. No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything. It's just strange.  (He stares out the window, lost in thought)  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive,  and then... People just...disappear. Eerie. Really eerie. Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I  mean aren't you going to be late? Oh really? I didn't know that. turns to face him. Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information  at all... Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman. Mr. Bateman? So...you hang out here a lot? 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli? (Looking at his glass)  Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much  more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting,  don't you think? Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli? I mean they want to get caught. I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's  taken a leave of absence. Not really. Do you remember where you were on the night of  Paul's disappearance?  (He checks his notebook)  Which was on the twentieth of December? Wait. That's not what I've got. That's not the information I've received. Let's see... (He flips through his notebook)  That you were with- Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen? Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman. Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch  in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information? And if you could try and pin down where you were  the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a  lot easier. Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I  just bought it on my way here. Not a big music fan, eh? Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll  call your secretary about reservations. and Bateman are sitting at a corner table. (Very surprised)  No hash browns? But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I  mean- it's-have you been here before? (Looking at him like he's nuts)  Suit yourself, I guess. So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on  what you did? I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up. According to his date book, and this was verified by his  secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam. I've questioned him. Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't  be sure. Yes. Yes. (smiling) I checked it out. It's clean. He wasn't with Paul  Owen. He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,  Harry Newman, George Butner and �  (He pauses, Then looks up)  - you. Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for  a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking.  Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or  later.  (A pause)  I mean, to think that one of his friends  killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too  ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?"
6,american-psycho,PRICE,"Yes. Clarify. You'll look like you consciously worked for the look. It looks that way, doesn't it? He took them away because the portions are so small he  probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place.  This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia? That's Paul Owen. (Distracted by the waitress's  cleavage as she bends over to  uncork a bottle of wine � the  waitress glares at him)  Some weasel from Kicker Peabody. Yes. McDufus, I am. Lucky bastard. The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking  of reasonable... (Offering card)  You take Amex, dude? There's this theory out now that if you can catch the  AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected,  then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular  dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for  Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy- Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it. I'm shaking. You open it. Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it? Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips  the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort)  Oh my God... It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low! I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it  on my fucking All-Bran. (screaming)  SHUT UP! I guess you're right... (Raising his voice)  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY! (Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider)  No, FUCK YOU!!  (He collapses, panting against the stall door)  Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it. The menu's in braille. I have to talk to you. Oh, who gives a rat's ass? (Wired on coke)  Oh ho ho. That affects us? What  about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that  affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri  Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of  Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us? Like what? Listen, Paul. Squash? How about Friday? (Whispering)  Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that? (Suddenly enthused)  What's that, a gram? That's really nice. (Holding the card up to the light)  Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so  tasteful? But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Raised lettering, pale nimbus white... I have to talk to these girls? They're models. (Clapping his hands together)  Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no? Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to  sign a peace treaty with him between the United States  and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know. You're not confused, are you? Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's  at Tunnel. (Shouting) I'm leaving. I'm getting out. This. (Screaming)  Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving. I'm leaving! I...am...leaving! No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm  disappearing. Goodbye! Fuckheads! Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders. How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit? (To Bateman)  I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous. I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that  way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so  fucking, I don't know, cool about it? And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about? Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless  Old codger. But inside... But inside... Bateman? Come on, what do you think?"
9,american-psycho,JEAN,"Late? Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what  he was canceling or why. And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17. After six. Oh?

I have no plans. Anywhere you want? Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision. Oh, I can't.  (Sighs)  I don't know. What about...Dorsia? Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want. You didn't give them a name. Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view. Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some. Want a bite? You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right?  You look great. Very fit. Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't  want to ruin your willpower. Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school,  but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life  where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure. No, not really. (Shyly)  Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused  on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about  changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing. Who's Ted Bundy? What's that? Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy? Sorry.  (She puts the spoon in the carton) Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to? Hmmmm. Was that...Evelyn? Are you still seeing her? I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that. Do you want me to go? I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get  involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you  want me to go? No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.  You're right, I should go. And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with  Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21. (O.S.)  Patrick Bateman's office. (O.S.)  Patrick? Is that you? (O.S.) Where are you? (O.S.)  Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and  David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks. (O.S.)

You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye. I want a firm commitment. (Distracted)  Why? What's wrong? Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk  about? (Motioning to the waiter for water)  Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just  avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee? But your friends are my friends. My friends are your  friends. I don't think it would work.  (Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin)  You have a little something on your upper lip. You're really serious, aren't you? But what about the past? Our past? You're inhuman. No, no, no. (Sobbing)  What do you want me to do, what is it you want? Oh God, I can't believe this. (Surprisingly calm)  Where are you going?

She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman  leans over and pulls her back up. Are we here? This is Dorsia? Mmmm...thanks, Patrick. (Dazed on lithium)  I want you to fuck me. Luis is a despicable twit. No, you idiot. I said ""Is it a receptacle tip?""  Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip?  Get off me. Pull out. (screaming)  Pull out, goddamnit!

Oh God, just get it over with. Will you call me before Thanksgiving? What are you doing tonight? That's nice.

3,indiana_jones_raiders,INDY,"No. We don't need them. We'll leave them. Once we've got it,  we'll be able to reach the plane by  dusk. If they knew we were here, they would  have killed us already. So this is where Forrestal cashed  in. Competitor. He was good, very good. No one ever had what we have...  partners. (back turned) Assuming that pillar there marks the  corner and... Let's go. Forrestal. Now, Satipo, we don't want to be  discouraged by every little thing. (taking torch) Let me see that. Try not to touch the vines. That's what scares me. You wait here. Adios. (eyeing the Hovitos) Too bad they don't know you like I  do, Belloq. (yelling) Get it going! Get it going! GO! I can't stand snakes. I hate them. I don't know. Just because Belloq  had it doesn't mean he kept it. Getting it away from those Indians  would be a neat trick (a hard look) I hope they got him. That's all right, Phil. Thanks a  lot. No. I'll see you Thursday. Hey, if you don't like them, I can  always return them. Then what's wrong? What kind of people? (concerned) Government? I've already served. (nods) We haven't spoken in ten years. I'm  afraid we had a bit of a falling  out. (negative) Just rumors. Somewhere in Asia, last  I heard. I understand. (to himself) Tanis. Ain't that somethin'! Ah, Ravenwood's no Nazi. They're looking for the headpiece to  the Staff of Ra. Only half of it. Ravenwood had the  other half. It all has to do with the Ark of the  Covenant. (the Army guys look  mystified) The chest the Hebrews used to carry  around the Ten Commandments. An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark  from Jerusalem and took it back to  the city of Tanis. A short time later,  Tanis was consumed by the desert in  a sandstorm that lasted a year. But  before that, the Pharaoh had had the  Ark hidden away in a secret chamber  called the Well of the Souls. Which  is where the Staff of Ra comes in. Now this was rather clever. The Staff  was really just a big stick - oh, I  don't know, say like this - (he indicates about  six feet) no one really knows for sure. Any  way, it was capped by an elaborate  headpiece with a carving of the sun  at the top. What you had to do was  take the Staff to a special map room  in Tanis - it had the whole city  laid out in miniature on the floor.  When you placed the Staff in a certain  spot in this room, at a certain time  of day, the sun would shine through  a hole here in the headpiece and  then send a beam of light down here -  to the map - giving you the location  of the Well of the Souls... (nods) Which is probably what the Nazis are  after. Look like? Why, it's right here... Yes. That's what the Hebrews thought. Who knows... lightning... fire...  the power of God. Oh yes. The Bible tells of it leveling  mountains and wasting entire regions.  Moses promised that when the Ark was  with you, ""your enemies will be  scattered and your foes fell before  you"". (pause) An army which carries the Ark before  it is invincible. Oh, there's one other thing that  Hitler undoubtably believes about  the Ark... (a long pregnant pause) It's said that the Lost Ark will be  recovered at the time of the coming  of the True Messiah. Most certainly. This isn't really a good time. All right. Come on in. I'll be in a minute. (smiles) Good work, Marcus. I had a feeling  this would happen. And, of course,  the Museum gets the Ark when we're  done. Okay, here's the way it's gonna be.  First, I'll high-tail it to Shanghai  and get the piece from General Hok.  Then I think I know where I can find  Ravenwood. If only I can get - I'll worry about that when the time  comes. My only hope is to find the  Well of the Souls before the Nazis  do. What's the hurry? (he's felt better) Great. Got it. I've got to get to Nepal. Hello, Marion. Nice to see you, too. (getting up) Take it easy. I'm looking for your  father. What happened? Do you find him? Not a bad way to go. Doing what he  loved. Why not leave? Go back to the States. Where you gonna get it? I need one of the pieces your father  collected. I never meant to hurt you. You knew what you were doing. I guess that depends on your  definition. Look, I did what I did. I don't expect  you to be happy about it. But maybe  we can do each other some good. Shut up and listen for a second. I  want that piece your father had.  I've got money. Enough to get you back to the States.  Where are his things? Everything? (giving up) That's too bad. Seltzer. You're a tough broad now, aren't  you? I can only say I'm sorry so many  times. A bronze piece, about this size. In  the shape of the sun. Probably broken  off at the bottom. Has a little hole  in it, off-center. Does that sound  familiar? Do you know where it is? Three thousand. American. Maybe. Okay, five thousand. That's all I  can give you now. I can get you more  when you land in the States. I'm back, aren't I? You can trust me. Why? I trust you. I've heard that. (moving back) Bossy, aren't you? Tomorrow. Hello. Let's get out of here! It's here? Forget it! I want you out of here.  Now! Let's go! (figuratively) I owe you plenty! (smiles) You're something! I knew the Germans would hire you,  Sallah. They couldn't have an  excavation in the desert without the  best digger in Egypt. Tell me about the map room at Tanis. Those Nazis are moving awfully fast. Belloq. So he got away from the  Indians. This is going to be more  interesting that I thought. (indicates the  headpiece) Even Belloq won't be able to find it  without that. Can you make anything  of those markings? They're nothing  I'm familiar with. What is it, my friend? Do you really need that monkey? And your brains. (dragging Marion on) He'll be OK. Come on. Come on. (to Marion) Run! Get out of here! Go, dammit! Go! Marion. (doesn't even look) Too bad. I'm drinking alone. Belloq. I ought to kill you right now. Not a very private place for a murder. Try the local sewer. Now you're getting nasty. What about your boss, der Fuhrer? I  thought he was waiting to take  possession. I hope your friends are patient.  Dangerous work, Belloq. Tell me, did you get away with the  idol? You know, if it's God you want to  talk to, maybe I can arrange it. Yes. Yes, I'll come now. (nods) Thanks you. (grave) Marion's dead. And they made the calculation in the  map room? (resigned) The Well of the Souls. Just want I need. How 'bout the height of the staff?  Did Belloq get it off of there? You said their top section was blank.  Are you absolutely sure? Belloq's staff is seven and a half  inches short. They're digging in the  wrong spot! My God! They aren't kidding! What time does the sun hit the map? We haven't got much time. Where are  the Germans digging for the Well of  the Souls? Okay. Let's go. (stage whisper) Sallah. (he waits, then louder) Sallah! (loudest) Sallah! I though you were dead. They must have switched baskets.  Thank god for that! Bless those  bastards. Have they hurt you? (putting the knife  away) I have to leave you here for a little  while. I know where the Ark is. If I  take you out of here they'll start  combing the place for us. Keep your voice down. Look, you don't know how glad I am  to see you. And I don't like doing  this. But the whole thing will be  shot if you don't just sit here  quietly. They haven't hurt you in  the last twenty-four hours, they  aren't going to start now. I'll be  back to get you in no time. There! The Ark must be in that stone case.  What's that gray stuff all over the  floor - Why snakes? Why did it have to be  snakes? Anything else. Lots of torches. And oil. I want a  landing strip down there. Don't touch it! Never touch it! Hurry up! Why did it have to be  snakes? What the - Why don't you fellows come down here?  I'll show you. Don't panic. There's plenty of time  for that later. Wave that at anything  that slithers. Just watch the floor. (he spots something) There! Come on! Stay here! I'll be back in a minute. We're going  through this wall. Just keep your eyes open and get  ready to run. No matter what happens  to me. Come on! I guess not. I think I'd be dead. Absolutely. Out. Don't do that. It scares me. Look! When the Ark gets loaded, we're  already going to be on that plane. Get out! Get out! Where is it? You two get back to Cairo quick and  get us transportation to England - a  plane, a ship, anything. I'm going to get that truck. I'll  meet you at Omar's. Be ready for me. (still searching) I don't know. I'm making this up as  I go. It's lovely. That's what you look like. What would you like to recapture? Did I ever say I was sorry I burned  down your tavern? You saved my life. Seems things have worked out kind of  even. Maybe we should consider all past  accounts closed. What else? The engines have shut down. I'm going to find out. What's wrong? Holy shit. Damn! Hold it. (the Nazi react) One move from anybody and I blow  that box back to Moses. What about you? Talked to God yet? (Belloq's eyes flash) Where's the girl? That depends on how reasonable we're  all willing to be. All I want is the  girl. We'll keep possession of the  Ark only till we've got safe transport  to England. Then it's all yours. Then the Ark and some of us are going  up in a big bang. I don't think Hitler  would like that a bit. Now I don't  want to talk about this anymore.  Show me that girl in five seconds or - It's a bad habit. I'm trying to break  it. Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him  I'm on my way up. Marion! Marion, can you hear me? Hi. Glad I could make it. Let's get out of here. Are you game? (grins at her) Okay. Let's do it. Whatever you do, don't touch it.  Let's put it on the floor. We'll go down that side. Shoot anyone  who looks at us crosseyed. (to Marion) Get down! (heated) That's a powerful force. Research  should be done - Who? We may be able to help. Yeah, like what? It's not the Ark... but it'll have  to do."
7,indiana_jones_raiders,MARION,"That does it! I've been patient with  you no-goods long enough. I'm not  open at 2 o'clock for myself, you  know. It's all for you. And how do  you repay me: Trouble and noise and  blood on my floor! I won't have it.  Everybody out! Out! Out! We're closed.  Closed! Do your killing outside! And  don't leave any bodies on the porch! Hey you, deaf one! I said out of my  place. I don't mean next Easter, I  mean now - Get up and get out. (bitterly) Well you're two years too late. Go home, Mahdlo. I'll see you  tomorrow. Avalanche. Up there. He was digging.  What else? He spent his whole life  digging. Dragging me all over this  rotten earth. For what? Hell no. He's buried where he was  working. Probably preserved real  good, too. In the snow. (vitriolic) Don't give me that stuff! What do  you know? (she takes a drinks) I'm the one that was left in a bad  way. He didn't have a penny. Guess  how I lived, Mister Jones. I worked  here. And I wasn't the bartender. (another swallow) Finally the guy that owned the joint  went crazy. Snow crazy. They took  his away screaming. As they dragged  him out, he said the place was all  mine for life. Can you imagine a more evil curse? (pause) So far, it's working. I'll go back. I'll get there. Not  that there's a soul there who knows  my name or cares. But I'll go. And  when I do, they'll know me. 'Cause  I'm going to go back in style. With  money. A goddamn lady! If I knew that, you think I'd still  be running this dive? I'll tell you something Indy. I've  learned to hate you in the last ten  years. But somehow, no matter how  much I hated you, I always knew that  someday you'd come through that door.  I never doubted that. Something made  is inevitable. (hopefully) Why are you here... now... tonight? You son-of-a-bitch! You know what  you did to me, to my life? This is  your handiwork. I was a child! I was in love. It was wrong. You knew it. Why start now? How much? Gone. I sold it all. It was all junk.  The junk he wasted his life on. You look disappointed. I like that.  How's it feel? (nods at his empty  glass) What are you drinking? (refilling his glass) Real man's drink. Me, I like scotch.  And I like bourbon. And vodka and  gin. I'm not much for brandy. I'm  off that. It's no act, pal. This ain't  Schenectady. You really have money? You don't  look rich. (Indy nods) I may be able to locate some of his  things. I know who's got them. What  do you want? Maybe. How much? (negative) That'll get me back, but not in style.  This doodad must be pretty important. I knew it would happen eventually. I  knew it. Something had to go my way. (pours herself another  drink) I've got to think this out. I'm used  to bargaining with yaks. You word, huh? (Indy nods) Just like you said you'd be back  last time? That was your word too. Come back tomorrow. Because I said so, that's why. It's  about time I called the shots in  this relationship. Wait a minute. Leave the five thousand  here. (Indy hesitates) You want trust, give some. I want to  smell your money. You're an idiot. Hold it. Come here. That's right. Give me a kiss. Get out of my place. The bar's closed. What do you want? Why, are you willing to offer more? No. But I know where it is. How 'bout a drink for you and your  men? (tough) Fine. Why don't you come back tomorrow  when Jones is here and we'll have an  auction? Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know who  you're used to dealing with, but no  one tells me what to do in my place. Wait! I can be reasonable - You don't need that. I'll tell you  everything! Unbelievable! Not without that piece you want! (pointing) There! (looking around) You burned down my place! (literally) You owe me plenty! I am something. And I'll tell you  exactly what - I'm your partner! Why, thank you. I like you too. Oh, no! You don't have to have it  around if you don't want it - I'm surprised at you, Indy. Talking  that way about our baby. He's got  your looks, too. (looking disappointed) Hey! Hey!... where're you going? Indy-y-y-y! They were throwing me around like a  rag doll. No. Not since I got here. They just  asked about you - what you knew. The  Frenchman's got the hot's for me.  I've been playing that along. Oh,  Indy, get me out of here. What's wrong? (louder) Cut me loose! (screaming) I said get me out of - I swear to you, I know nothing more.  I have no loyalty to Jones. He's  brought me only trouble. Don't put me down! What are you doing? Whatever you're doing, do it faster. (grabbing him) Where are you going? (panicked) What do you mean? (O.S.) (screaming) Where are you?! Indy! Where are you?! Please Lord! The snakes... are they here? Do you know where you're going? Thank god. Where? Us too. What about you? How are you going to get that truck? I have a feeling I'm not the first  woman to travel with these pirates.  There's a whole wardrobe in there. I feel like a virgin bride in this. (takes a drink) There are some things you can  recapture in this life, but that  isn't one of them. (after a long pause) Nothing. That is the way it is. No. Then again, I burned up that  plane. And you saved mine. That's the way I like them. No. Not yet. What is it? Why? Oh, Indy! Thank god you're here. What about the Ark? Hell yes! We've made it this far. Slow it down! Quite. Well they aren't going to tell you,  so why don't you just forget it. I'd  think you'd had enough of that damn  Ark. Just put your mind on something  else."
8,indiana_jones_raiders,BELLOQ,"Dr. Jones, you choose the wrong  friends. This time it will cost you. And you thought I'd given up. (smiles) Yes, too bad. You could warn them...  if only you spoke Hovitos. (in Hovitos) Kill him! Good evening, Dr. Jones. It was not I who brought the girl  into this dirty business. Sit down, please, before you fall  down. We can behave as civilized  people. I'm afraid it will be your  last opportunity. (looking around) These Arabs will not interfere in  the white man's business. They do  not care if we kill each other off. (takes a sip of wine,  refers to it) Terribly difficult finding a decent  vintage here. You were quite vigorous  in Shanghai. Unfortunately, our friend  the Wild Boar had taken the precaution  of making several copies of the piece. How odd that is should end this way  for us, after so many... stimulating  encounters. I almost regret it. Where  shall I find a new adversary so close  to my own level? I know you despise me. We always  hate in others that which we most  fear in ourselves. And you and I are  very much alike. We have always done the same kind of  work. Our methods have not differed  as much as you pretend. I am a shadowy  reflection of you. But it would have  taken only a nudge to make you the  same as me, to push you out of the  light. You know it to be true! How nice.  And how ironic the timing. Do you realize what the Ark is? (very intense) It's a transmitter. A radio for  talking to God! And now it is within  my grasp. (quieter) When the time is right. When I am  finished with it. Yes. Very. You may consider yourself  fortunate that your involvement  concludes here. (negative) I was lucky to get away with my life.  The Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded  about the whole matter. (smiles) You have not changed. But, please,  do not reach for your weapon until  you are ready to die. Next time, Indiana Jones, it will  take more than children to save you. I cautioned you about being premature  with that communiqu� to Berlin.  Archeology is not an exact science.  If does not adhere to time schedules. Nothing. I have made no promises. I  said only that it looked very  favorable. Perhaps the Ark will still  be found in an adjoining chamber.  Based on the information in our  possession, my calculations were  correct. Perhaps some bit of evidence  still eludes us. Perhaps I tell you, she knows nothing useful. Believe me, you made a mistake. If  you would just give me something to  placate them. Some bit of information. I cannot control them. Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you  doing in such a nasty place? No thank you, my friend. (he glances around  him) I think we are all very comfortable  up here. (down to Indy) After all these years, it is most  considerate of you to aid me in this  way. The girl was mine! Goodbye, mademoiselle. (a pause, then with  respect) Indiana Jones... adieu! We must get the Ark away from this  place immediately! And be very careful! That girl goes with me. It will be  part of my compensation. I'm sure  the Fuhrer would approve. If she fails to please me, you can  do with her as you wish. Good. We must take the Ark there  now. (playing him) Let me ask you this - Would you be  more comfortable opening the Ark in  Berlin - for the Fuhrer - and finding  out only then if the sacred pieces  of the Covenant are inside? Knowing,  only then, whether you have  accomplished your mission and obtained  the one, true Ark? Jones, your persistence surprises  even me. You are going to give  mercenaries a bad name. No! Not in the presence of the Ark!  Take him outside. Indiana Jones, I salute you. I am  even a little sorry you will miss  this moment."

14,indiana_jones_raiders,SHLIEMANN,"The Fuhrer is not a patient man. He  demands constant reports and he  expects progress. You led me to  believe - My feeling exactly. She was in  possession of the original piece for  years. She may know much. (really evil) If properly motivated... I'm surprised to find you squeamish.  That is not your reputation. But it  needn't concern you. I have the  perfect man for this kind of work. I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr.  Jones. Our prize is awaited in Berlin.  But I do not wish to leave you down  in that awful place... (he give a sign) ...all alone. She is of no use to us. Only our  mission for the Fuhrer matters. I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you  have that clearly in mind. Stay with the Ark! Sabotage! (to Gobler) Have it put on the truck. We'll fly  out of Cairo. And Gobler - (Gobler stops) I want plenty of protection. (yelling) If anything happens to that Ark,  we're all dead men ! The Fuhrer will  see to it! Take it aboard the Wurrfler! (to a Sergeant below) What about Jones? Savage. You are not in a position to  ask for anything. We will take what  we wish and then decide whether or  not to blow your ship from the water. What do you think, Captain? ...yet. Let the vermin live. We must  be on our way. I am uncomfortable with the thought  of this - (spitting it out) Jewish ritual. Are you sure it's  necessary? Doctor Jones, surely you don't think  you can escape from this base. If we refuse? Jones, this is the second time I  have seen you looking very foolish. I'll help you. This time I'll kill  you myself. Stop them! Kill them!"

You  can go to see him tomorrow. (a worried expression) Indy... something bothers me. It is the Ark. If it is there, at  Tanis... It is not something man was  meant to disturb... Death has always  surrounded it. It is not of this  earth. I thought we would find you there. (indicating the kids) Better than the United States Marines,  eh? Yes, I know. I am sorry. (pause) More reason than ever to beat the  bastards. (he touches Indy) Life goes on, Indy. (indicates the kids  again) There is the proof. I have much to tell you, Indy. (nods vigorously) This morning. Belloq and the boss  German, Shliemann. When they came  out of the map room, we were given a  new spot in which to dig... out away  from the camp. About seventy-five inches. (to Amir) A home run, my friend, grand slam! (to Indy) We have a saying - ""A little luck is  better than much smartness."" Indy,  pardner, you are very lucky fellow. Bad dates. There! That is the map room! Just after eight. Asps. Very dangerous. Holy smoke, my friends! I am so  pleased you are not dead. (suddenly remembering) The Ark!

A fish can breath out here. Did your man deliver or did he deliver? And it wasn't so easy. You better believe they did--every single one of them. So, you do like it, don't you? Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by their bedroom window. Oh, right. Right. You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done. Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr. Yeah. What if they don't like me? No, really. You remember how we met? Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'  Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go? [gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside, you, right now. No! Coral! Coral? Coral? Oh! Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...Nemo. I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes. Okay...huh? All right, I'm up. Nemo! [gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. All right, where's the break? You feel a break? Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids? Are you woozy? How many stripes do I have? Answer the stripe question! No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh, you're okay. How's the lucky fin? Let's see. Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years. Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush. Do you want this anemone to sting you? Brush. You missed a spot. There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here! All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes, if you wanna do it four times-- All right. Come on, boy.  No, and I don't plan to. Sea turtles? I don't know. Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin, hold my fin. Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go. Come on, we'll try over there. Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher? Yes. Shocking, I know. Marlin. Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them   were walking, so forget that I-- I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds. That's where I would play He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin. Whoa, you better stay with me. Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes. Bye, Nemo! Bye, son! Be safe. Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you? They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you, insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!? Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy! Nemo, no! You were about to swim into open water! It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know-- This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out there. You know you can't swim well. No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two. Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things but you just can't, Nemo! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little too soon for him to be out here unsupervised. Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me? Don't touch the bo--Nemo! You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big...big-- I'm coming, Nemo! Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo! Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no! Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please! Waaaah! Ooh, ooh... He's gone, he's gone.. He's gone. No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat. You have? A white one? Where!? Which way!?  Hey! Wait! What? Huh? Wait a minute.. What? You're showing me which way the boat went! Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going! If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish! Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this! Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps] Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Parties are fun, and it's tempting but-- O-okay..that's all that matters. Me? I don't have a problem. Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish-- Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the sea mollusk says to the cucumber... Nemo! No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers. Ugh! What do these markings mean? I can't read human. No, no, no, Dory! No, Dory! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay? I'm so sorry. Ohh... Dory, look out! /DORY Aaaaaaaah! There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape! Dory, help me find a way out! There's gotta be a way out! Let's go!  Well, then here. Read this now! Oh no, it's blocked! I need to get that mask! No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick grab the mask! Nemo. Nemo. [mutters] Huh? No, no! What does it say? Dory! Wake up! Get up! Come on! Come on!  /DORY AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! [gasps] The mask! Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask! Get the mask! Get it! It's gone. I've lost the mask. You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone. I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down. Dory, no singing. See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head! Dory, do you see anything? That was me. I'm sorry. Who could it be? It's me! Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything? A light. No, I see it too. What is it? I'm feeling...happy. Which is a big deal for me. Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone. I can't see! I don't know where I'm going! The mask! Oh, gee! Read it! Just read it! P. Sherman doesn't make any sense! Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah! Waah! Waaah! Waaaah! That's great! Speed read! Take a guess! No pressure! No problem! There's a lot of pressure! Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure! Duck! I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead. Whoo-hoo! [singing] We did it, we did it! Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! No eating here tonight, whoo! Dory. Dory! What did the mask say? Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that? /DORY Aaah! Excuse me. Ex-excuse me, um, hi. Do you know how to get to--hello? W-w-w-wait! Can you tell me--hey! Hold it! Wait a minute! I'm trying to talk to you. Okay, fellas, come back here. Please, one quick question. I need to aaaaand they're gone again. [sighs] Okay, all right. Here's the thing. Y'know, I just, I-I think it's best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by..by myself. Y'know, alone. Without, without..well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it's just that I don't want you... with me. I don't wanna hurt your feelings.. Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'. No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you. No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how I can get to-- It's a swordfish. [coughs up answer]Lobster. What? Will somebody please give me directions? I'm serious. Thank you. What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name. Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there. Nemo. But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me. [gasps] Great! That's great! Dory, you did it! Well, listen fellas, thank you. Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing. Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it. And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go. Trust you? Look! Something shiny! Oh, it just swam over the trench. Come on, we'll follow it. Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time. You wanted to go through the trench. Dory! That's a jellyfish! Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see. I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look. It did. It's just that.. ..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings. Come here. It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we? That we don't wanna touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one.[gasps] /DORY Aaaah! Don't move! This is bad, Dory. [gasps] Dory! Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you, that's it! Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game. A game. Yes. All right, here's the game. Um, whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins. Rules, rules, rules! You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops. W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait! Dory! [gasps] Dory! Wait a minute--whoa! Dory! So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time. I can do this, just be careful. Oh, I don't think so! The question is, Dory, are you hungry? Yeah, 'cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish is the winner! Woohoo! We did it! We're gonna...Dory? Oh no. Dory! Dory! Dory! [gasps] Dory! Uggghhh! No, you're doing fine! You're, you're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Uh, where does P. Sherman live? That's it! Oww! Ow! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ow! Stay awake! Stay--awake! Awake... Awake...wake up...Nemo... Ooh... Ooooh... Ooooh..what happened? What're you talking about? Ooh. Ooh..ooh, my stomach. Ooooh.. So Mr. Turtle... Crush? Really? Okay Crush, listen I need to get to the East Australian Current. EAC? Grabbing--waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Whooooooaaaa!!! Stop! Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney. [gasps] Dory! Dory! Is she all right!? Dory, Dory! Dory! Oh, Dory. I-I-I'm so sorry. This is all my fault, it's my fault... Huh? [gasps] Oh my goodnes! Well, apparently, I must've done something you all like. Heh, uh, dudes. Ow. All by themselves? But-but-but dude, how do you know when they're ready? W-w-wai-wait-- Hold on, I need to breath-- One at a time! Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me. No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it. [sighs] Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long long way from here. And my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on   him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. So we swam   out in the ocean to follow them... Where!? I don't see it! You mean the swirling vortex of terror!? Of course it is. It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you're really cute! But I don't know what you're saying! Say the first thing again! /DORY Aaaaaaaaaah!!! Weeeeeeeeeeee!!! Whoooooooooooaaaaa!!! Aaaaaaaaaaah!!! Woohoooo!!! Whoooooaaa!!!  No worries! Thank you, dude Crush! Oh, Nemo would've loved this. Hey, ooh! Hey, Crush! Crush, I forgot! How old are you? Hundred and fifty! Hundred and fifty, I gotta remember that. Yup. Yup. We're gonna just swim straight. Dory? Boy, this is taking a while. Okay. It's me. It's me. Me. And the next one's just a guess: me. W-w-wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight! We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me! Wha--? Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here! Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out our bones! Look, I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the 'Let's Not Die' card. Of course, I do. All right. Ha..hello. Nemo. Sydney. Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella. Uh, Dory..what're you doing? What're you doing? Are you sure you speak whale? Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away. He's not coming back. You offended him. Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach. No, don't try humpback. Okay, you actually sound sick. Don't do that! It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard! It's just as well, he might be hungry. Move, Dory! Move! Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Ooof! Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Would you just stop it!? We're in a whale! Don't you get it!? A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here! No, you're insane! You can't speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! [sobs] No. No, it won't. No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him. What? What's going on? Dory. Dory. ..AAAAAAAAAAT'SSS-GOOIIIIIIING.. Dory. Of course, we've stopped. Just stop trying to speak whale, you're gonna make things worse. [gasps] What is that noise? Oh no. Look what you did. The water's going down! It's-it's-it's going down! Look, it's already half-empty! Stop that! It's half-empty! Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!? Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch! Stop talking to him--waaaah! What is going on!? No! No more whale! You can't speak whale! No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo! Dory!  /DORY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Ha ha ha! We're alive! You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son! THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK-YOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUU-SIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! Okay. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him. Come on, Dory. We can do this! No, but the boat has to be here somewhere! Come on, Dory, we're gonna find it. Dory, wake up, wake up. Come on. That's not a duck. It's a--pelican! Whooooaaaaah! No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast! I gotta find my son Nemo! Dory, keep going! He's crazy! Hop in your mouth, huh? And how does that make me live? Yeah, right. That's Nemo! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! /DORY Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Where's Nemo!? Where is he!?  Oh yes, you can! Charge! [gasps] Nemo. Nemo! Dory. If it wasn't for you, I never even would have made it here. So, thank you. It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone and I'm going home now. I'm sorry, Dory, but I do. Sorry. Just trying to get home. Nemo? Nemo? Dory? [gasps] Nemo! Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo! Nemo! Oh, thank goodness! It's all right, son. It's gonna be okay. Move! Move! Dory! No, no, no! No! Dory! Nemo! No! Get out of there, now! No, I am not gonna lose you again! You're right. I know you can. Now go! Hurry! Well!? You heard my son! Come on! ..swim down together! Do you understand what I'm saying to you!? Swim down! down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down! Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! Just keep swimming! Keep swimming! You're doing great, son! Come on! Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming! Almost there! Keep swimming! Oww! Dory! Where's Nemo!? Oh no. Nemo! Nemo? Nemo? It's okay. Daddy's here, daddy's got you. Oh, thank goodness. No, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo. Hey, guess what? Sea turtles? I met one! And he was a hundred and fifty years old. Yep. Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as Sandy Plankton!? He was a hundred and fifty! Not one hundred! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything? Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Go! I'm gonna win! Oh! My own son beats me! So just then, the sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says : 'with fronds like these, who needs anemones?'! Bye, son! Have fun! I love you too, son. Sorry! Now go have an adventure! Nemo. Bye, son."

2,finding_nemo,GILL," No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out. I just wanna see him do it, okay? Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Perfect. Yeah. I'm thinking, tonight, we give the kid a proper reception. State your name. Brother Bloat, proceed. From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait. Welcome, brother Sharkbait! Enough with the Sharkbait. Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed? We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do? I'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help him escape. We're all gonna escape! 'Cause we've got him. You see that filter? You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me? /NEMO [sighs] He's fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think? You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait? Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you. Peach, any movement? Keep on him. My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet. All drains lead to the ocean, kid. Aah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to 'ya. That's your cue, Sharkbait. Okay, you gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber and I'll talk you through the rest. Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp. Nicely done! Can you hear me? Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening? Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. Careful, Sharkbait. He'll be fine. Try again. That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady. That's great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out. Sharkbait! Get 'im outta there! Get 'im outta there! Stay calm, kid! Just don't panic! Sharkbait! Grab hold of this! Feed me more! Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it! Pull! No. We're done. Hey, Sharkbait. No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean. I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid. Really? Three sharks!? He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait. [gasps] [gasps] Sharkbait! Sharkbait! We'll help you, kid! Can you hear me, Sharkbait!? Nemo! Can you hear me!? Sharkbait, you did it! That took guts, kid.  No cleaning. Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it. Good work. Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning! He he! Did you hear that, Sharkbait? Are you ready to see your dad, kid? Of course you are. Y'know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbor waitin' for you right now. Boss must've installed it last night while we were sleepin'. What's it say, Peach? I can't hear you, Peach. Stay down, kid! I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin'. [gasps] Nemo! Hold on! I'm comin'! Swim down! Come on, kid! Swim down! Come on! That's it! Good work! [gasps] Nemo!  Just calm down, Nemo. You won't go belly up, I promise. You're gonna be okay. Sharkbait! [gasps] He's still alive! He's gonna get flushed down the toilet! He's gonna get outta here! Oh no, not the trash can! He's over there! Quick! To the top of Mt. Wannahockaloogie! Bloat! Ring of Fire! Sharkbait. Tell your dad..I said..hi. Go get 'em. Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean. Come on, Peach! You can do it!"

You put it on hold. Look. You also called Mexico. Very romantic. I won't change my mind, mom. It's not about Forks, it's about  Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we  barely know each other. I cut it since last time I saw you. Good. (grimacing) That's right. One bathroom. I can do it  - Yeah... I think I remember.. . (re: the dads) Are they always like this? No way. The truck is for me? It's perfect! Maybe I can give you a ride to school. Too bad. Would've been nice to  know at least one person. I'm kind of the �suffer in silence� type.

Do you know the  Cullen family? No... well, a little. ... Okay. Mom, where's your cell?  You got me new tires. No one's  ever done that before. I mean... nothing. An animal? Be careful.

Charlie rushes up. I'm fine, dad. Calm down. It's okay, Tyler. Dad, it's not his fault- But you didn't. It would have been a lot worse if Edward  hadn't knocked me out of the way. It was amazing he got to me so  fast. He was nowhere near me. You told her?! She's probably freaking. 'S POV - EDWARD, ROSALIE, AND DR. CULLEN Can I talk to you for a moment? (off his nod) How did you get over to me so quickly? You were next to your car, across  the lot. Yes. You were. I know what I saw. You stopped that van. You pushed it away.

I'll go if you stop saying that. Thanks... but your mood swings are  giving me whiplash. What does that even mean? So let's say, for argument's sake,  that I'm not smart. Would you talk  to me? Tell me the truth? Okay... how �bout radioactive  spiders? Kryptonite? (beat, looking closer at him) No. I don't believe that. You're  not bad. You can be a jerk, but  it's like this... mask.

You're different. Where are we going? No! The sunlight will kill you. Slow down. No. I'm not afraid. No! Edward? Where are you? You're... beautiful.. . I don't believe that. I don't care. It doesn't matter. I trust you. I trust you, Edward. I'm here. Edward? (realizing) Oh... I thought you hated me when we met. I know you can. I'm afraid. Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll  disappear.

Can they all read minds, too?  Your house? With your family? But... what if they don't like me? I'm glad I amuse you. What is it? Come to visit your truck? A person did that? It's... wonderful.

No fair, reading Charlie's mind. And since when do vampires like baseball? (to Esme) Now I get why you need the thunder. That has to be a home run. Yer out?  I said, leave me alone! Get out! It's over. I have to get out of this place.  Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now. (a pained whisper) I can't hurt him. No, Dad. I broke up with him. That's why I have to leave. I don't  want this.

Edward  said they weren't always certain. So the course James is on now will  lead him to... a ballet studio? No. I don't know. I used to take  ballet lessons as a kid.

As if  you could fight me off. I'm designed to kill. I've killed people. I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in  my life. I'm dangerous to you. Don't. You... took me by surprise.  (collecting himself) I don't know how to... do this. Me, and my family, we're different  from others of our kind. We're not  nomadic, we have a permanent home.

James is a tracker. I saw his mind.  The hunt is his obsession, and my  reaction set him off - - -- We're a large clan of strong fighters  all protecting one vulnerable human. The first place he'll go is your  house. He'll track your scent  there.  Bella, don't do this. Just think  about it, please  - (whispering) I'll be in the truck. He'll forgive you. (off Bella's startled look) Slide over.. . It was the only way he'd let you go. Your father's safe now, Bella. The  tracker is following us  - It's alright. It's just Emmett.  Alice is in the car behind us. But not impossible. We'll tear him up I'll run Bella south, while you lead  the tracker away  - (studies her, torn) Can you keep your thoughts to yourself? Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the  tracker will pick up Bella's scent. We won't, there are five of us, two of  them. When it's done, I'll come get you. You're my life now. I'm coming to get you.  (hates having to say Bella, we're in too deep. We can't  change how we feel.. . In a couple hours. Then you and  I  will go somewhere. Together. The  others will keep hunting. I'm strong enough to kill you. Venom - - No! It doesn't have to be that way. What's the other choice? You said  -  I -- won't be able to stop  - It's alright, Bella. I'll make it  go away. We took care of him. And the  woman, Victoria, she ran off. (darkens) You're in here because of me. The worst of it... was thinking  I  couldn't stop - Bella, you should go to Jacksonville.  Where I can't hurt you anymore.. .   Prom is an important rite of  passage. I don't want you to miss  anything. Shall we? See? You're dancing.  (angry) I won't end your life for you. That's how it's supposed to happen. Her visions change, Bella. Is that what you dream about?  Becoming a monster? You really want this? You're ready right now? You're going to have a long and  happy life with me. Isn't that  enough?"
8,twilight,CHARLIE,"Your hair's longer. Guess it grew out again. How's your mom?  I'll just put these up in your room  - Bella, you remember Billy Black. Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you  down the hill. So what do you think of your  homecoming gift? Just bought it off Billy, here. Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas  here since she was four. You always do. Easier than washing dishes. I remember.. . How was school? Meet anyone? (looks up sharply) Are people talking about them again? Just �cause they're newcomers. We're  lucky to have a surgeon like Dr.  Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky  his wife wanted to live in a small  town. Lucky his kids aren't like  a  lot of the hell-raisers around here. I just don't like narrow mindedness. That's why I got you new tires.  She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires. CHARLIE I'll be late for dinner. I'm heading  down to Mason County. A security guard  at the Grisham Mill got killed by some  kind of animal.. . You're not in Phoenix any more,  honey. They've been hunting it for  a week with no luck. Thought I'd  lend a hand. Always am. Bells. Are you alright? It sure as hell is not okay. (stern, cutting her off) We nearly lost you. You can kiss your license goodbye. Good. Dr. Cullen. Edward? Your boy? I just have to sign some paperwork.  You better call your mom. Your mother called. Again. She always did know how to worry. Known him going on thirty years. We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella.  But in the meantime.. . ... I want you to have this. It'll give me some peace of mind. Pale Ale.  Spread the word out at the rez, will  ya? Keep the kids out of the woods. Guys, we got something  - Ordered you the seafood combo. I'm healthy as a horse. The suspect's moving east. Kitsap  County Sheriff is taking over from  here. They're putting extra guys on. Your friends are flagging you. It's okay you wanna join them. I'm  just gonna turn in early anyway. It's a Friday night. Go out. The  Newton boy's got a big smile for  you. Nice family, the Newtons. None of the boys in town interest you? Just... you should be around people.  I leave you alone too much. He's too old for you. And I thought you weren't interested in  any of the boys in town. Now? He's out there? Good. Bella's going to play baseball? Well. More power to you, I guess. (sotto) You got that pepper spray? Bella? What happened? Bells. Did he hurt you? Then what? Did he break up with you? I thought you liked him? Your mother's not even in Phoenix. You can't drive home now. I'll take  you to the airport in the morning.  Bella... I just got you back. Heard that before. (sotto) I put new pepper spray in your bag. ... and... you look beautiful."
11,twilight,JAMES,"Always the same inane questions.. . �What do you want? � The question should be, �will it hurt? � By tomorrow they'll be half way to  Winnipeg. -- who suddenly SCREECHES to a halt. His head WHIPS  around at her and he lurches into a crouch, his nostrils  flaring, excitedly, eyes locked on Bella. You brought a snack. (O.S. ) Nice house you have here. Not the  best on the block, but comfortable. I was prepared to wait for you.  But then Mom came home after she  received a very worried call from  your Dad. It all worked out quite  well. I must say, Forks High School doesn't  protect its students' privacy very  well. It was just too easy for  Victoria to find your previous address. You're protective of her. That's  nice. You can still save her. But  you'll need to get away from your  friends. Can you do that? If your mother's life depends on it? The old ballet studio around the  corner. And I'll know if you bring  anyone along. Poor mommy would pay  the price for that mistake. That's my favorite part. Stubborn  child, weren't you? Sorry. But you really made it too easy. So to make things more entertaining,  I'm going to make a little film of our  time together. Borrowed this from  your house. Hope you don't mind. Excellent! An escape attempt. It'll break Edward's little heart. He will. His rage will make for  more interesting sport than his  feeble attempt to protect you. Beautiful! Very visually dynamic.  I chose my stage well. Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that  what makes you special? Because  frankly, I don't see it. Too bad he didn't have the strength  to turn you. Instead, he kept you  this fragile little human. It's  cruel, really. Well done! You've succeeded in  annoying me. Tell Edward how much it hurts. Tell him to avenge you. Cut! The end. You're alone... because you're  faster than the others. But not  stronger."

Now, you know if you change your  mind, I'll race back here from  wherever the game is. You might. You've always hated Forks. (O.S. ) If spring training goes well, we could  be living in Florida permanently. Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It  ran away. Screaming. I literally  repel technology now.  Phil's working hard.

Because they're all together.  Like, together together. The  blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big  dark-haired guy, Emmett.. . ... they're a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal. But they live together. And the  little dark haired girl, Alice,  she's really weird.. . ... she's with Jasper, the blonde  who looks like he's in pain.  I  mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster  dad slash match maker. That's Edward Cullen. He's totally gorgeous, obviously.  But apparently, no one here is good  enough for him. Like I care. Guess who just asked me to prom! I totally thought Mike was going to  ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be  weird? I know, right? Eric, you stood up once. On a foam  board. (teasing) Keep her company. Her date bailed. She invited Edward. (O.S. ) He's not here.   Oh my God, we need to hit the  stores in Port Angeles before the  dresses get cleaned out. I think this halter makes my boobs  look big. What do you think,  Bella? Bella? You said that about the last five  dresses.  We waited, but we were starving  - I - we - understand. We were  just... leaving, so  - Really thoughtful. "
0,megamind,MASTER MIND,"The real Einstein once said, ""God does not play dice with the world."" He was right, because the world is MY dice. Is that understood? Alright, then - clean slate. Do we have the girl? Reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated. Alright, let's not keep the lady waiting. (O.S.) Miss Ritchi, we meet again. I trust you gentlemen know the very sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe Uberman. And Miss Ritchi, I trust you've already met my new crew: The Mad Geniuses! In a way, I already have. What about my revenge? You have a wicked tongue. I hope you rid yourself of that when you're my queen. Power corrupts absolutely, Miss Ritchi. And when I have ultimate power over this city, I have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it. (annoyed) What is it!? (O.S.) Over here, old friend. (ON MONITOR) Actually, I wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend. (ON MONITOR) Oh, can't I? I have attained control of the Earth's most abundant energy source. I doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED POWER OF THE SUN!!! Excellent. Stop here, I like this view. Any last words? (genuinely concerned) What's going on? What kind of trick is this? Yeah, so? Your weakness is copper? (carefully skeptical) Well...let's not get ahead of ourselves. I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S GONNA RAM US!!! (CONT'D) (horrified) HOLY SHIT! 11. ...so I did. (absentmindedly) Oh, right. (feigning pleasure) Great, great. Put it on the pile. No. Maybe later. (CONT'D) What is it, Plato? When I want your opinion I'll beat it out of you. I have defeated my greatest enemy. I have free reign over Metro City. I have more wealth than a thousand Sultans. I've achieved all I have worked for...so why am I so unhappy? I mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil. (MORE) 23. MASTER MIND(cont'd) And, I have accomplished something he had only dreamed about - the destruction of Metro City's champion. I tell you, I've always lived with this unquenchable thirst. I thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power. But now that I've pretty much accomplished both, I am at a loss. (snippy) Oh, really? He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying, little gnat to him? ...What's the second part? YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD YOU GET SUCH A NOTION? Who the hell is John Cusack? John Cusack, huh? So all I have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS. Please, get a hold of yourself. I've got it! 32. I've got it! It's plain and simple. Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: I must create a new superhero. (ignoring him) Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis! Prepare the subject. (CONT'D) Plato, pour the toxic waste. (CONT'D) Drainage. (CONT'D) Well, Severs? Okay then. And this one? Ah. Does he have extraordinary strength? Can he fly? Resilient to weapons fire? He just breathes under water, then. Plato, the radioactive spider, please. Anything, Stenwick? We're gonna need more venom. (CONT'D) How `bout now, Stenwick? ....Stenwick? This has proven to be a challenge. I just don't know what I want. What do I want? 35. (CONT'D) I want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong. Someone who doesn't seek power - instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion. That's it! Why make a copy when the real thing will do? Then we'll make a new one. Plato, bring me the box! Behold - Uberessence. The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers. 36. Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never got around to following up with that. ...Right. Man, he was good! Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure. (CONT'D) Somebody like him! (into phone) A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. I love it. He volunteers. He doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul. (O.S.) (over radio) Then return to base. We have much work to do. Now, we're sure this won't kill him? Good. Slight electrical shock? Follow him. Welcome to your second birth, Hal Stewart. (CONT'D) Instruction is very important in the formative years. Every hero needs a mentor, a father figure to look up to. (reading paper) Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't believe it. He misspelled his name. (CONT'D) No matter, I suppose. (CONT'D) We've now fully established Titan as Metro City's hero. They will love him just as they loved Uberman. Everything is going according to plan. You know, Einstein, maybe I should have called you Socrates. He also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself. To what? The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth, like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over. You dare? What - did - you - call me? THAT is none of your business, knave! Silence! I'm warning you, Einstein. I said silence! (CONT'D) Get out of my sight. 62. (CONT'D) Oh, no. Don't look at me. You're not gonna get all freaky about this, are you? I only did this because I wanted to talk to you on the same level. You know, without all the baggage? You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about. (CONT'D) Roxanne! What? (mumbling to himself) Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato, it's his fault. He's the one who sent me on this weak-willed path. I'll filet his scrotum for this. Me, a creature of evil, in love with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous. I hardly give such matters thought I should just go up there and just lay it all out to her. ""Roxanne, I like you - I always have. Oh, and I'm sorry I blew up your ex. (realizing the absurdity of his words) Yeah, that would go over like a pants-less clown at a child's birthday party. What the hell am I even doing here? Who cares what she thinks? I'm a supervillain and here I am acting like a love struck schoolboy. Forget this. I control my own destiny! 66. (CONT'D) (disgusted) Perfect. Hello, Triple A? 67. I'll call you back. (O.S.) The lady said no. No, it's a goo gun. It goos. (CONT'D) It's...a prototype. Don't - EVER - say that again. Don't flatter yourself. My, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves. No. (overly calm) Fine, why do you ask? Go on. Just with business, my minion. Just with business. I've decided it is time. Yes, we've created our hero, now it's time to give him a little motivation. To be simply good is not enough. A hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected. Yes, he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure. Gentlemen, it's time for Operation Mentor Kill! Alright, people, we don't have much time. Titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out. (CONT'D) How's the death ray coming? Hum. Let's turn it down a few notches. It's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we? (CONT'D) Anything on the radar yet? I see. Well, he must be planning something big. Are the flame androids deployed? Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da Vinci, take your places next to me. (CONT'D) No slouching. He'll be here. That's the way it works. (CONT'D) Unprofessional, that's what this is. No, it's disrespect for the craft. (CONT'D) Would Uberman have kept us waiting like this? Of course not. He was a pro who knew the score. It's time we spelled out a few things for this Titan. I will not be made a fool of. Do you know who I am? 75. Oh, so NOW you want to get down to it. Well, I want to get a few things off my chest first. (CONT'D) Of all the inconsiderate - Do you have any idea how long we waited for you? We're you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge? (interrupting) -You got to thinking? There's nothing to think about. I'm the villain. I do something bad, you come and get me. Maybe you're right. What's the point? (CONT'D) What are these? (baffled) Where did you get all this? From where? Well, what about your mentor? You want to team-up? 77. What do I think? (CONT'D) I think you're probably the biggest idiot I've ever met. I mean, I can't believe you. All your gifts, all your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment. You know what? Your kind of people make me sick. Oh - gee - I am so sorry! 78. (CONT'D) (under his breath) Of all the people to pick, it had to be this loser. I wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? (O.S.) It hurts. It! I just made myself redundant, old friend. Well, there's no use crying about it now, we must take action. I'm not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon. We must destroy Tighten. 82. Yes, but he possesses the same flaws present in Uberman's DNA - copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin always said: ""If something works don't dick with it."" (O.S.) Your time has come to an end, Titan! There can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's me. I have a better idea - NOW! (CONT'D) That's copper my good man. Your one weakness. (MORE) 84. MASTER MIND(cont'd) For all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect. He's not as dumb as I thought. What's funny? Wow, I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college. So it is. 86. Well, then I wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find. I need your help. You're not going to like what I'm about to tell you. Tell me about it. Well, the evil thing he did by himself. My goal was to give MYSELF purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner. And they call me Master Mind. In hindsight... (almost ashamed) I had some left over from something. I infused him with it. Yeah, that's why I decided to tie you up. He seemed nice. 88. Yeah, good to know - NOW! It's a modest profession! My lair is in the direct path of the ball. You don't understand. I have certain equipment that's - that's highly unstable. I sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay? It's experimental - only one in the world...Well, how do you think I power all my inventions? Someone like me can't pay for electricity. The bills would be outrageous. It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one...If destroyed it could... (proudly) Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard, actually. That little baby is amazing. I'm quite proud of it. (MORE) 91. MASTER MIND(cont'd) (off her deadpan reaction) I mean...we'd better find a way to stop him. Did Uberman have a hideout? A cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. C'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. Roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance. Whose house? Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist? But he disappeared - ""Metro City doomed."" You know, I never thought I'd say something like this, but here it goes - (CONT'D) Not if I have anything to say about it. Such a dark place for one such as you. I wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice? Good lord, man. You've only been dead for two months. (CONT'D) A disguise so simple, it's ingenious. No wonder I never caught on. (CONT'D) Two lives, yet in both you were an ideal. Perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end, old friend. (CONT'D) I'll miss how predictable you were. (CONT'D) Hello? Anyone here...besides..all the BIG MEN who are with me now? (CONT'D) (to himself) What's the worst you're gonna find? (MORE) 94. MASTER MIND(cont'd) The man was a boy scout, not a serial killer. Ahhhhhh! I might just ask you the same question. I had thought I incinerated you. Roxanne told me. As for your ruse, I forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently. Figured if they could do it, so could you. But one thing I couldn't figure out - A few months? How long had you been planning this? I see it all so clearly now. (CONT'D - V.O.) You must have done it just seconds before the observatory exploded. 96. (CONT'D - V.O.) You bore out from under the cage. Then, using your Uber-Speed, - (CONT'D - V.O.) - you made your way to safety, where you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere. (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D) Then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion, then... But why fake your death? Why go through all of it? You could have just quit. And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to disappear? I just can't believe it. This whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart? There's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean, your city. You're really going to do nothing? You're the only one who can stop him. A plane? Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap. I got lucky. (suddenly confused) What do you mean? Game? - Was that all this ever was to you? You know, I was trying my best every time I fought you. Those `outs' as you call them were unintentional. I guess I was never really a match for you, was I? (CONT'D) (thoughtfully) Then how can I expect to be one for Titan? (CONT'D) What about Roxanne? I guess I wasn't the villain I thought I was, and you...you weren't the hero I thought you were. Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible. I told you, Titan is too powerful. If he's set on destroying us, there's precious little we could do about it. To another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight. We'll start over, we'll go back to doing what we do best. Plato, do you have a better plan?! (CONT'D) Hello...Roxanne? Right now I'm packing, later I'll have a snack on the train. In a word - yes. I didn't create this - the god's of irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve. I'll make the time. (CONT'D) You can leave with us. You'll be safe. Will you listen to me, no one can stop him. I'm afraid you have an inflated opinion of me. What? Sweet words, but that man is dead. Please, Roxanne, just come with me. Roxanne? Roxanne? Dad, it's me... (he looks around to make sure no one can hear) ...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked in a while, and I'm sorry. It's been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy. Anyway...You raised me to be the worst that I could possibly be. And I've tried to live up to that as best as I could - even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. But I'm about to do something now that would really piss you off. I'm going to go against everything you ever taught me. I hope...I hope that maybe you'll look down at what I'm about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. If you could do that, then maybe - in your own little way - you could - for probably the first time - find a reason to be proud of me. Well...either way, you're probably going to see me real soon. (calling over his shoulder) Men? Stop packing. Our work is not finished here. C'mon, slow down C'mon. Gutterball! Bowling? What other trailer park sports can you play? 112.  Shit! Stupid monkeys and their fruit. Could it really be that easy-- (CONT'D) Didn't think so. I'm alive. Uberman? 114. I thought. For what? WAIT!!! Quick joke - What's the capital of Thailand? It's bang cock! So, I guess pennies are good for something. 116. They're cheering for me. It's a...it's nice, you know? I usually don't get a lot of feedback. (whispering) But I also kind of caused all this. What happens when they find that out I was the cause of some of this? I guess that is all in the past. I don't think I'd go that far...I mean I just...er... Yes? Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit. (CONT'D) We're okay, right? (O.S) I don't think it would go with your outfit. I'm gonna give you a chance to surrender. Way to take out those two goons, guys! (apologetically) Sorry, we're new at this."
3,megamind,ROXANNE,"You didn't need to turn around like that. I can recognize the stench of failure. Looks like a real group of winners. At the risk of sounding cliche', you'll never get away with this. We go through this every time. You kidnap me to get to Uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes whatever lame trap you've come up with, and takes you and your cronies to jail. I propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by YOU letting me go, and ME forgetting this whole thing ever happened? We can say it was wasting everyone's time. I'm sorry. What makes you think I would want to be your queen? Uberman! Uberman? (CONT'D) You killed him! It's...um...It's good to be back. Thanks for everyone's cards and concerns. I really appreciated it - now I'm ready to climb back on the horse. It's okay. Aren't you? Frank, listen. I want to go back to work. I NEED to go back to work. What're you doing? It was a traumatic experience. Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were...close. But what I really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work. I thought you'd be happy to have me back. 19. Yes? In three weeks? (disgusted) Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an idiot. Oh, because they can't use me to get the big story. (defensive) I didn't use him. We were. 20. Very in love. Okay. So, where are they going to move me if Brad has my spot? Bake sales and pet stories. I'll take it. I just wanted to get back to work. I keep trying to tell people it wasn't really like that. Uberman and I - We were kinda having problems. We broke up. Maybe someone who's a little more aware of his faults. Someone a little more sensitive. 25. Well, until he miraculously comes walking into my life, I'm just going to take a little reflection time for myself. Councilman, is it true that your brother-in-law's construction company won the contract for this project? What's it feel like to be a hero? Shit. (stunned) You're...you're. (captivated) ...Yes. (catching herself) I mean, excuse me? Right. I did have a boyfriend - until fairly recently. I'm sorry - this is so surreal! Things were complicated. He was a man married to his work. There was...there was a lot of competition in his line of business. I'm sure you know what that's like. ...The body-builder who used to play The Hulk on TV? Well...one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than I ever did. But enough about my problems. Right, well, he seemed to need him more than he needed me. It was conflict he thrived on. He always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if Master - I mean, this guy were gone. It was like he needed it, like oxygen. What? I'd love that. (V.O.) John? (V.O.) Hi, it's Roxanne. Listen, I...I really enjoyed talking with you the other day. (V.O.) Great. God, I feel really silly, and if you have a lot going on I totally understand. But, I was wondering if you maybe wanted to have lunch. (V.O.) Great. How does the park sound, around noon-ish? (V.O.) Great, see you then. 52. How's your sandwich? Hope you don't think I'm too forward. Some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out. I just find you really easy to talk to. You know, you're not at all like you are in the movies. Yeah. I don't know - You have this strange, refined way of speaking. Anyway, when we were talking the other day I just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that we've known each other for years. You know what? This sandwich is disgusting. (CONT'D) Of course I already ate half of it. I wonder what that says about my character? Thanks, but knowing me, I was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. It might have been okay at first, but I just made it bitter. When I look back, I probably shouldn't of expected so much from him. He was already a giving person. You know, one of those go out and save the world types. I was selfish, I guess. I didn't want to share him with anybody else. They broke the mold. Listen, Brad. We were just in the area. I was just trying to - He's right. Old habit, I guess. (to Brad) We'll get out of your way. Don't get me wrong, I love being a reporter. I don't think I could do anything else. It's the consequences of what we do that I'm having a problem with. It's supposed to. I got someone I cared about killed. If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been involved. Was he an actor? Jail? 63. Was he ever successful? Thanks for this. You know, this is embarrassing, but it's been a long time since I - (CONT'D) I think it's starting to rain. We might want to find a table inside. Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a long time since...well, I've been with someone I...enjoy being with. Oh my God. This...this is too much, even for you. God, I go out with you, tell you my innermost thoughts. Baggage? You burned my boyfriend alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch! Stay away from me. Damn. Please be open. (CONT'D) Thank God. A pack of Lady Strikes, please. I don't think so. Hey! (CONT'D) Are you following me or something? 69. Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you. (CONT'D) What a minute...all that stuff you use to say to me when Uberman was alive - about me being the loyal queen by your side as you rule over Metro City. That wasn't just super villain rhetoric, was it? You actually meant it! (coldly) Do you really think I would be with someone like you? That's my diary. It's personal. What do you want? So you knock me out and tie me to a chair? He's really out of control. I should have known. You have something to do with this, don't you? - With Titan turning evil. 87. (confused) You're talking like you made him. Let me get this straight. You missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass. That's pathetic. And his powers, they're just like Uberman's. Why would he have his powers? YOU DID WHAT!? You did all this because you wanted purpose? Hal Stewart. He's the guy we thought saved that woman and kid. Turned out he was just trying to save his own ass. You picked a bowler to give super powers to? My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy the whole business triangle. 90. What? Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want anything to happen to your hideout, would we? What do you mean? A HYDROGEN reactor? A REACTOR? - Vaporize the entire city! What? It's under his house. Wayne Scott's. (interrupting) He disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him. Not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous man. (CONT'D) Looks like you got what you always wanted. Uberman is out of the picture and Metro City is doomed. Long enough. (CONT'D) Don't you have something else you can go do? What are you going to do about Tighten? You're running away? You created this monster... There's no time for self pity. 105. I'm not going anywhere. You have to try. The city needs your help. What the hell's happened to you? The Master Mind I knew would never have run from a fight even though he knew deep in his heart that he didn't have a chance in hell of winning it. It was your best quality. You need to be that man right now...I... (heart felt) I believe in you. No...I guess you are a coward after all. (whispering) The guy can outrun bullets. I don't think either one of us is in that kind of shape. I'm here with the cause of the destruction in Metro City. He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall ""Asskickiness."" He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown Metro City as his pins. Annals. Nevermind. Hal, I know everyone treated you like shit, but you don't have to do this.  111. Pretty strange, huh? You saved them. You saved everybody. How's it feel? What they don't know won't hurt them. You're the hero. Master Mind? 117. Stop talking. What is a hero? Well, there are many different kinds. There are those who hear a call, like the policeman or doctor, then there's the kind the public creates in their search for meaning and hope. Then, there are those who have the courage to change."
5,megamind,TITAN,"What's the ""T"" stand for? What's that supposed to mean? I don't think this mask is big enough. Are you sure no one is gonna recognize me? 55. Well, boys, there's no need for all this just to get the free toaster. Justice. Now it's my turn. (CONT'D) Hey, George, here comes the sun. (CONT'D) Say, Paul, your mother should know...that you're a scumbag. (CONT'D) John, all you need is love... (CONT'D) ...and a good urologist. 57. (reading) Ten thousand dollars! (CONT'D) (unenthusiastically) I...can't except this. Law and order is it's own...um...reward. It's a message to all the scum out there. Uberman may be gone, but Metro City has a new protector, and his name is ""Tighten!"" Man, what the hell happened down there? Wait a sec - (CONT'D) THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!! Crap. (CONT'D) PAT! (CONT'D) You okay? What's that? Master Mind? Why? This injustice will not go unpunished. Master Mind, if you can hear me, Tighten is coming for you. Oh, for crying out loud. Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah! You're actually the guy I want to see! Well, at first I was going to. You know, because that's what I figured I was supposed to do. But then I got to thinking- - I got to thinking...what's the point? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. (proudly) Get this: I stole them. From all over. You see, once you killed Pat and ruined my other apartment building I was pretty pissed off, so I figured I'd go, find you and kick some ass. Then I thought to myself: ""Okay,then what?"" I mean, if we were to fight, what would I get out of it? Would I get my apartment back? Would I be able to pay the bills? Tell you the truth? He was kind of a dick. I mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but it's volunteer work. Now you've always had the right take on all this. I mean, when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it. I mean, when you don't get caught, which, no offense, isn't very often. And that brings me to what I wanted to propose to you: Who could catch you if I'm by your side? You got the brains, I got the brawn. We could even call ourselves that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at this. (CONT'D) I even designed us some new costumes. (CONT'D) See, you'd be brain, so you got a little one on your costume, and then I'll have brawn on mine...once I figure out the best, you know, visual interpretation of it. What do you think? I worked hard on this. Now, hold on. You're going a little too far. Hey, I mean it. I don't need you, I don't need anybody. I have the power to do and take anything I want. And now, I'm gonna take back everything this city owes me. Beware Metro City, it's time for Titan to collect. (CONT'D) Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY THE WAY I WANT TO FLY! Morning. Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just here to make a withdrawal. I can have anything I want. I'm like a god. Point to any woman in this bar. I could have her in a second. (to Old Barfly) Hey, you wanna get with this? What do you want? That's the question, isn't it. I mean, what do you want when you can have everything? (MORE) 83. TITAN(cont'd) I suppose what I really want is to never be forgotten again. I want to do something that can never be cast aside or one-upped. I want a - what's it called? - A legacy. I want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I like the sound that. Oh. What? Really? (CONT'D) I guess I should leave town then, huh? You know what? You're nothing but a bug. Not even worth my effort. Closer. I want to show the people my real face. (CONT'D) Recognize me? That's right, I'm really Hal Stewart. Former hero and bowling teacher at Kingpin's Bowling. With my new found power, I've recently started to wonder what sort of legacy I should leave. Should I be a hero? I tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed. I was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me - Okay, so what if I didn't ""purposely"" save them! Well, I'm going to make something that can't be taken away from me. I'm going to create a permanent monument to my greatness. One that won't be so easily forgotten or erased. I intend to create a new category in the Guinness Book of World's Records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling. My thanks to the city planning commission. This wouldn't have been possible without them. Tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow. Alright, I want this whole thing to look ESPN professional, understand? (CONT'D) You guys are about to get some good footage. I might need a little room, though. (to beer) Miss me? (CONT'D) Didn't mean to get you involved in all of this. (CONT'D) Hey, man! You killed my suds! (CONT'D) That's one was for you, beer. Guys, please tell me you got that last bit. You're kidding me. I give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing? Looks like I've given the story of the century to the wrong man. Wait. What about that other reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs. Where can I find her. You've been very helpful. Man, have I got a story for you. What pose would be best? The corny folded arms thing? Or maybe on the hips, like this. No, makes me look like a flamer pirate. She's right, Frank. 107. Also got super hearing. I promise not to keep the both of you long, but you'll thank me when this is all over. And I'm going for the biggest strike ever. And you, Metro City, have a ringside seat as I cement my name in the anal of history. What? (in quiet professional bowler announcer voice) Like Tiger before him, a young savior has come to raise a sport from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart, a young man with a dream, realizing that dream here today, folks. (MORE) 110. TITAN(cont'd) One might click there heels and say ""There's no place like home"" upon finding themselves in such a fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much at home right were he is - with a ball in hand and glory in his sights. You're right. I don't HAVE to do anything. Isn't that cool? Here's one for the record books!  (CONT'D) What the...?  YOU! You are becoming a real pain in my ass. I should have done this a long time ago. What the hell? (CONT'D) GODAMNIT! (CONT'D) No more games. If you don't mind, I'm going to punch trough your face now. Oh...Did I interrupt something? Where you going, buddy? (CONT'D) Welcome to Paintown. Population: you. (CONT'D) Time to finish this. What? Huh - I don't know. (CONT'D) Ow."
7,megamind,HAL,"It's a sport of honor, focus and grace. Honor the ball, focus on the pins, release the ball not hard and fast, but as if you were releasing a baby dove.

Vinnie, I don't know where you're getting these accusations - Oh, which one do you supposedly have here? I've got this one, Benny. So, Cinderella. Can I help you find your glass slipper? (with a leer) Seven - Well, maybe I could interest you in something in an EIGHT. Namely, me. Lesbo. From the angle of the camera, I can see where you might have gotten the wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't think you've thought this through. If you fire me, who's gonna be captain of the alley's bowling team? 16. No, I said I WILL BE on the pro circuit. Wow...If that's how you feel...I guess we should then talk about what kind of severance I'm gonna get. Hey...what about my ball? Thank-you! (not knowing what she's talking about) Huh?

Fine, but you better be convincing. Here she comes, go to work. Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me look at you. You know, in life we're all given no more than we can bear. This happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it - Maybe to be an inspiration to the other little Peteys out there. Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying? Now c'mon, go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended. Petey, wait a minute. Don't run into anything! (obviously playing it up for the woman's benefit) Oh, there it is again. This is really getting embarrassing now. (to Attractive Woman) Oh, crap. You got me. I guess that looks kinda bad. God, I hate the weather in this city. I don't feel good.

You scared the bejesus out of me. How'd you figure out I was still alive? Wait, how do you know my identity!? The skeleton? Something I ""borrowed"" from a medical school a few months before. I always planned to retire - eventually. I mean, come on, you can't do this sort of thing in your fifties. You'd just look ridiculous. But the responsibility would still be there. (MORE) 97. WAYNE SCOTT(cont'd) A cop can retire and stop handing out speeding tickets - but people expect more from superheroes. I tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt in Zimbabwe without everyone expecting me to do something about it. I figured, out of sight, out of mind. Both of my lives have so much baggage. It's time for new baggage, you know? I don't want to hear about it. That's why I don't have a television in here to remind me of all the things I SHOULD be doing. Hell, I could get a wife to do that. Good and evil have a way of balancing themselves out. If this guy is as bad as you say, somebody will rise up to fight him. It's just the order of things. You found me, didn't you? 98. (CONT'D) I know it's hard, but you'll find someone else someday. Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a plane to catch. Going to Barbados for a little change in climate. Now, if you'll excuse me, I got to go pack. (CONT'D) You were a good foe. I'm sorry if I've let you down. If it makes a difference, you were the best foe a hero could ask for. Well, you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper. Now that made me sweat a little. Took me way too long to drill out from under that cage. Anyway, it's a good thing for my sake that I could always count on you for an out. 99. C'mon, we always threw each other a couple of bones. You would always leave me an out in one of your `full-proof' traps, and I'd never had you incarcerated at a penitentiary that you couldn't eventually escape from. It kept our little game going. Oh. I think we both got what we wanted out of our relationship. She got a career out of me, and I got plenty of other things out of her. But I'm ready to move on to greener pastures. 100. Roxanne!

It's just that you seem to have lost your lust for our profession. You've stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time watching Uberman specials. ...I sort of have a theory about all that. Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman was more important to you than you thought. I think you sort of have a thing for Roxanne Ritchi. Sir, your plans always involve Ms. Ritchi either being kidnapped or placed in danger. If that's not love, I don't know what is. It's the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in the ink well.

I believe he defeated you before you could, master. Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece of work. He used to teach bowling at Kingpin's.

Everything alright, sir? You...just...seem... ...distracted. You mean? You mean? Not yet, sir. All twelve. He's certainly taking his time. I don't understand it. He seemed to have every characteristic we were looking for in a superhero. It won't be easy. Uberman had a sense of decency and genuine love for the people. That was his weakness and was easily used against him. I guess not...Funny, though. Funny Uberman didn't think of the same thing. With our tails between our legs?"

Where the hell did you get that? (whispering) Yeah, if the plan is getting us in jail. I just fail to see the point in all of this.

Symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness and loss of appetite. Really? Let's see. There might be epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness... Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer. (to Dr. Woodruff) I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second? Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone. (into the phone) Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking. (listening) Oh, hey. (listening) Nothing important. I can talk. What's up? Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office. Intercut: (into the phone) Fuck that shit! We had plans! Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words. Oh come on! When has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work? Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt. Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin. No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter of the finest herb in New York City, and I'm not smoking it alone. (to Dr. Woodruff) Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration, and sometimes even shock. No.    I'd actually be pretty surprised. Dr. Woodruff is flustered.   He doesn't know how to react. Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad will keep paying for my apartment. I'm not really planning on going to med school. Well, I'm not an idiot. Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words. Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr. Woodruff's desk. He picks it up. Wow!    Is this your daughter? A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's hands. (O.C.) Yeah, I'm in here! Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar is not in the room, however. (O.C.) In here... Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA furnishings), where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a ""clipping sound"" coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked and appalled. Harold walks inside... I'm trimming my pubes. Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple more snips. On the floor, we see LARGE CLUMPS OF HAIR. The mirror's in here. (re: his crotch) Hey, check it out! It looks like a Bonsai tree! Chill out. It makes my Johnson look bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll end up with pubes like my dad. You've seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right? HAROLD notices something... Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months. (calling out to Harold) So what the hell is your problem, anyway? I assume you gave him the appropriate ""go fuck yourself."" Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say ""no"" once in a while. Now lets get high. Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to get that shit done later. Come on, let's smoke a couple joints. Harold thinks for a moment and then caves... One and a half. Now let's do this... Kumar exits the room... HAROLD hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see organized in rows of suits and button downs. So what? It's not like there's a shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor. Just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean I have to. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna smoke this fat blunt, get ridiculously high, and then get something to eat. I think we've already seen this one. Harold changes the channel... I love that shit! Harold continues flipping channels... And the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to... Hey look!   It's you! Kumar points to the TV where we see a CLIP FROM SIXTEEN CANDLES--[Long Duk Dong talking about quiche/round pie] Kumar laughs.   Harold isn't amused. We see another CLIP [Long Duk talking about the chores he does for the grandparents]. Hey, when are you gonna start doing some chores around here? Harold gives Kumar a ""don't even joke"" look. He then violently grabs the bong from Kumar and lights it. Kumar laughs as Harold exhales a lot of smoke... We're not low. No shit!    Let's eat! HAROLD bends down and picks up A BUNCH OF DELIVERY MENUS that have been left on the floor... Nah, I don't feel like delivery tonight. Nah, we've been there too many times. (beat) I want something we haven't had in awhile. Something different. Something that'll really hit the spot. I want the perfect food... I'm telling you, there's one right around the corner from that multiplex in New Brunswick. They walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment. On the side of the doorway is a MEZUZAH IN THE SHAPE OF A NAKED WOMAN. Harold and Kumar walk in without knocking... Rosenberg, Goldstein-- get up.    We're going to White Castle. Rosenberg and Goldstein continue staring at the TV... No waiting.   We're starving... Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing a piece of beef jerky from Rosenberg & Goldstein's coffee table. (scolding Harold) ...Put that down! We're not eating `til we get to White Castle. Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as soon, as Kumar turns his attention back to Rosenberg and Goldstein, he slips it his pocket. (to Rosenberg and Goldstein) Now come on guys, let's go. What the hell are you bringing that for? Harold hands Kumar his keys. Shit, I forgot my cell phone. (thinks for a moment) Nah, we've gone too far. Reveal that the guys are less than 20 feet from their door. ""Bing!"" The elevator door opens and the guys enter. Hey, there's your girlfriend. You actually gonna talk to her this time? What the hell are you doing? That was a perfect opportunity! You could have asked her if she wanted to go to White Castle. Harold doesn't say anything.   He looks down in shame. You're worthless. Dude, it's only awkward because you're a pussy. Just talk to her once and I promise you it won't be weird anymore... Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier. One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight. So what? She's fucking cute.     Let her touch your penis. They exit the front door of the building... Dude, forget about those pricks.    Let's just go. They continue walking... (getting frustrated) Jesus, that took forever. You know the purpose of a car is to avoid walking. (beat) And what kind of parking job is this? You're like a mile away from the curb. (laughing) Just fucking with you.   Now let's go out and get those burgers.   I'm fucking starving! They get in the car and slam the door. The engine starts and the car takes off, revealing that they were parked next to a Hey, Rold-- do you think C3PO is gay? pulls up to an EXACT CHANGE TOLL BOOTH. Dude, give me thirty-five cents. HAROLD sorts through some change in his hand and gives Kumar the money. KUMAR tosses the change into the basket and waits for the TOLL BOOTH STOPLIGHT to turn green. It doesn't. What's going on? It didn't register. (beat) Dude, give me thirty-five more cents. Should I just go through? I can see that. A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a number of cars lining up behind them. Right behind them, A BIG BURLY GUY leans his head out of a car... (to Harold) I'm going through. What the fuck is wrong with you?! No they're not! What? That was the last of our weed. Now we're in Newark of all places.    You know we're gonna get shot. We have to if we want to get out of here. Kumar points to a sign indicating that the HIGHWAY is ahead. Come on. How do you know they're not peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys? With that, the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN OF ALL TIME ROARS AS HE COMPLETES A MONSTER DUNK. In celebration, he violently bumps chests with his teammates. Why? Are cars not allowed to go through when a game's going on? When we were kids, we used to move to the side when we were playing in the street. The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down. I'm going through. KUMAR begins inching forward. Look.    They're moving.   I told you. Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar, they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all times. Harold is scared shitless. He then notices the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN holding the basketball. How do you know? Oh fuck. KUMAR puts the pedal to the metal and ZOOMS AWAY FROM THEM. sees a HIGHWAY SIGN-- ""NEW BRUNSWICK-- NEXT EXIT."" Rold, check it out!      We're almost there! Well, prepare to gorge yourself. I'll see your twenty and raise you five orders of fries. Don't worry, we'll find it. HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead... That means the White Castle should be just around the corner... We gotta get to the bottom of this! drives right up to the PICK UP WINDOW, where we see a chubby BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE... What happened to the White Castle? There used to be a White Castle right in this spot. Where is it? Please tell me there's another White Castle in town. Shit.   What are we gonna do? Do you really think that'll satisfy us? The BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE senses their desperation. (to Harold) I can make the trip if you're willing to. Forget about the med school interview. It's a non-issue. (enticing Harold) You can always do your work in the car. HAROLD thinks for a moment, then licks his lips. Then it's settled. No matter what, we're not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs. Agreed? KUMAR puts his hand out.   HAROLD shakes it. is driving with determination in his eyes. White Castle, here we come. I just wish we had some more pot. I'm almost completely sober right now. HAROLD ignores this. He's TYPING FEVERISHLY ON HIS LAPTOP-- trying to get his work done. Meanwhile, Kumar notices a sign on for the PRINCETON EXIT. Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here. Kumar takes the exit. We're gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into finding us some weed. Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the phone all the time. A twinkie? Look you twinkie bitch, you threw our weed out the window, so now it's your duty to make sure we're high as shit by the time we're eating those burgers. As long as she buzzes us into a dorm, we're set. Give me ten minutes in there and I guarantee I'll find some hizzy. is standing in the hallway, accosting random students. He sees one RANDOM STUDENT walk by... Hey! You know where I can get some chronic? The RANDOM STUDENT doesn't respond. Kumar is frustrated... What kind of Ivy League school is this? Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime of your finest herb. The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A GIANT PLASTIC BAG FILLED WITH WEED. He's awestruck... Oh my dear sweet lord... Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his hand away... Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops, bro! The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar. Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are you? Please. Like they want to go listen to a bunch of Phish records while you read your lame ass poetry. 109.   Got it. I'll see you later. Rold! Rold! You gotta come quick! There are these two filthy pussies who are just aching to get boned by us. KUMAR notices that CINDY is appalled by his choice of words. Uh...I mean...there are two very lovely, young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and I. That's bullshit. He's coming with me. Isn't that right, Rold? CINDY gives HAROLD an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her. Fuck that! KUMAR notices an open dorm room nearby. He enters the room, and returns a few moments later dragging an ASIAN FRESHMAN in his pajamas. He pushes the Asian Freshman over to Cindy... Here-- this is Harold's understudy.     You can do whatever you want with him. (to Harold) Let's go. KUMAR grabs HAROLD by the arm and drags him away. CINDY looks pissed as she watches HAROLD being taken away from her. takes the first puff of a joint. I can't believe you were gonna ditch me for the Joy Luck Club. You know what their parties are like. Just say ""no""! That's all it takes.      Now take a hit of this. Kumar hands Harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens and a SECURITY GUARD enters the hall. He sees HAROLD and KUMAR with drugs. Quick.    In here. The guys rush into the WOMEN'S BATHROOM. Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for us in the women's bathroom. Harold and Kumar hear TWO FEMALE VOICES outside the bathroom. Shit!    Get in that stall! There's a line of THREE BATHROOM STALLS on one wall. HAROLD RUNS INTO STALL NUMBER TWO (the middle one). KUMAR sees the BATHROOM DOOR START TO OPEN. He also runs into STALL NUMBER TWO and shuts the door behind him. The guys struggle to STAND ON THE TOILET BOWL.    Harold's laptop bag keeps smacking Kumar. CHRISTY and CLARISSA (THE TWINS) enter the bathroom.       They're in mid-conversation. Dude, I'm starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party... Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY GUARD from before appears in the hallway with ANOTHER is pissed off as he drives. (using his fingers) I can't believe it. We were this close to getting high and getting laid. Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex with us! And what about Cindy?! She was looking hot tonight! The fact that you're not into her just might make you gay! What?   You'd rather have Maria? From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head. Fine. Suddenly, KUMAR pulls the car over to the side of the road... Daddy needs to urinate. Harold rolls his eyes. gets out of the car (leaving the car door open). He walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen yards until HE FINDS A NICE BUSH. HE UNZIPS HIS PANTS AND STARTS Oh yes!   Yes, that's nice. is still peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY (FROM OUT OF NOWHERE) walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips his pants and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR! Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused. The Creepy Guy simply goes about his business. It's clear that Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple seconds, until he can't take it anymore... Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask you...why are you peeing here? Why did you decide to piss here right next to me? Why not that bush over there? Nobody was here when I chose this bush. I was just saying.... No, I just... (beat) You know what? Forget about it. I'm not in the mood to get stabbed right now. The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package. Thanks. gets into the car and shuts the door.     He hits the gas and continues driving down the dark road... I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But don't worry. Once we get on the highway, we'll be there soon. What's the big deal? Holy shit! HAROLD tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck.     KUMAR tries to help him. How the hell did that get in here? (looking at Harold's neck) Don't worry. He didn't even break your skin. You'll be fine. Ahh! Dude, get that fucking cancer raccoon away from me!!! Thank Christ! Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OF Goldstein? HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief. What the hell are you guys doing here? (to Goldstein/ignoring Harold) Dude-- how were Katie Holmes' tits? Yeah. Nice. (to Goldstein) Well, if you have the yellow fever tonight, there's a rocking Asian party over at Princeton tonight. Dude, you don't have rabies! We're not going to the hospital. Great, let's get out of here. Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT... Shit. turns around and sees HIS FATHER standing next to HIS BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire. 'S FATHER (thick accent) I hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today. Dr. Woodruff is a very good friend of mine, and let's just say he was not at all amused by your antics...and neither am I. Eat my balls, Saikat. 'S FATHER I will not tolerate this business from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one I'm setting up for you. Oh, come on, dad! 'S FATHER ""Daddy will not be coming on anything!"" You will be there and you will behave! I've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up. KUMAR lowers his head.   He's been put in his place. You're right. I'm sorry. KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug.   He even gives SAIKAT a hug. It won't happen again. 'S FATHER Good.   I'll speak with you tomorrow. KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he and SAIKAT walk away. HAROLD is stunned... Fuck that! Like I care what my dad thinks. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I skipped the interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me off? Fine! I don't need his money! I just needed to get my hands on these... KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS. Two words-- medical marijuana. HAROLD shakes his head in disgust. Look, I'm telling you, they see   an Indian and Asian guy wearing these and   they'll just assume we're doctors. Then   we walk right into the pharmacy and get   the weed. Harold does not appear happy he's doing this. We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna get toasted and then we're gonna eat delicious White Castle-- just like we planned. All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE (frazzled, touchy feely). He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry. Leave the talking up to me. On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST. He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain. What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest. HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous. Hold on. What we should probably use is marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery. We don't have time for questions! We need marijuana now! Get as much of it as possible! Like a big bag of it! KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands. (to himself) Shit. Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest. Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous... (disappointed) Very well. I guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way. KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face. Harold gives Kumar a look-- ""What the fuck are you doing?"" (CONT'D) First, we need to clear his C-spine. I want stat x-rays of the chest and abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we need 2 units of O neg on board. Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe what's going on. Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace. Ah, I see. The Patient's got a collapsed lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat! After a couple seconds go by... What's taking so long? (casual) Will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up? A chorus of ""yes, doctors."" (taking off his gloves) Well, it looks like my work here is done. Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous. He then leans down to the BLEEDING PATIENT, who is just barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits... (CONT'D) Say, you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way to get to the White Castle in Cherry Hill from here, do you? (nonchalant) Yeah. It wasn't bad. Hey, check it out!     Your movie's playing. Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater we see: ""JOHN HUGHES RETROSPECTIVE. CURLY SUE - 9:00. And look who went to see it... Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA standing outside, all by herself. He can't believe it. You see? You thought you two had nothing in common. But it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies. Hey, you wanna see if she wants to come with us to White Castle? Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an hour from home. And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. I mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and I was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment I'd tell you ""this is a sign."" Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way... (calling out) Hey Maria! MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN Hey, get your hand off the gas! Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas.   Just then, (looking up) Oh shit! Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us off the road! Fine. KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a ""POP!""   Harold and Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated. Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know how to change a tire. Harold looks in his trunk for the spare.    It's missing. I don't know. Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float? (realizing) Oh shit. That's right. I was with Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day. My bad. I'm Kumar. This is Harold.     Good to meet you, Mr...Freak Show. (whispering to Harold) Eww-- check out those boils on his neck! HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING. (whispering) Oh my God! You gotta look!     One of them's actually pulsating! (whispering) Now there's some sort of puss! It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen! (whispering) Don't worry, he can't hear anything.    Not with all that crust in his ear. HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard a thing. Harold seems relieved. Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife? But he did! It may have been in mid- sentence, but it was still clear as day. They reach the front door and are about to enter... Dude, Liane is fucking hot! Thanks. (beat) So, tell me Liane-- how are things between you and Freak Show presently? Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first? I'm not sure we quite understand... Um, are we talking about one hole or two? (to Harold) Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad. (beat) Shotgun anus! What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow jobs!? No.   You did. We both heard you. Positive. FREAK SHOW ponders this. No problem. Okay, let's agree never to talk about what just happened. searches for some clue of where they are. Dude, I have no idea where we are. All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead. Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up? Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know how to get us back on the highway. Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was my favorite TV show growing up! You were my idol! So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set? Even the chick who played the hot nurse? Well, our night's been pretty crazy too. We've been driving around for hours, trying to get to White Castle, but we keep getting sidetracked. You don't understand, Neil. We've been craving these burgers all night. Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop and get directions. KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET leading up to a gas station in the distance... I don't know. But we can't let him interfere with our quest. Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them. They have to jump out of the way. Cole parks the jeep and exits with (to Harold) He probably can't speak English... Who knew that learning Hindi would actually pay off? The guy says the highway's just down the road. We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes. HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS... (to Cole) Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something. (pissed off at himself) Shit. Cole and the Punks burst out laughing. (to Kumar, embarrassed) Come on, lets get out of here. Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated.   With their leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating. Yeah, I just hate those dicks. (beat) Fuck it. At least now we know where we're going. I'm so friggin' hungry... I think he did. Rold, calm down! I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to know that he'd fuck us over? Where are you going? There's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes. So after you talk to the cops we're still going to White Castle, right? You know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster. The computer responds to the first press. Every press after that is extraneous. This is ridiculous.   Just walk across. Come on, there's not a car in sight! Finally. A ticket?!   Are you serious? Harold motions Kumar to ""shut the fuck up!"" (to Officer Palumbo) Wait. Hold on. Bust my ass?! 220 dollars!? Are you crazy? Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys. (to Officer Palumbo) No, no, no. I understand what's going on. Let me guess. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? You'd pick on guys like us every day. But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, ""How can I still give them shit? I know! I'll become a cop!"" Well, congratulations. Your dream's come true. Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed. Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to Palumbo. (to Officer Palumbo) Hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? Or better yet, arrest him. Lock him up! With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!! (O.C.) (from inside the shaft) Rold? Is that you? (O.C.) Are the cops still there? (O.C.) I called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook park... (O.C.) I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust you out, and we'd get over to White Castle. (O.C.) Hey, fuck you! What did you want me to do? Stand there and take the hit? You know, I've never taken a swing at you before. Never. (O.C.) Look, Rold, I'm sorry. But you're not the only one dealing with shit. My dad's cutting me off, remember? (O.C.) You don't want my help? Fine!    I'm outta here! (O.C.) Uh...Rold?    How do I get out of here? Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief. (O.C.) This isn't good. We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THE Ow...my ass. Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell. You sure you don't want to get out? So what? We'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave. (beat) Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow. Harold thinks about this for a second. Yes! I was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys. Now I get to try all of them to see which one will... What's that smell? Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on Officer Reilly's desk. has his arms around THE BAG OF WEED as he helps it swing the golf club. It's a hole in one! KUMAR TURNS THE is lying on the bed, while THE BAG OF WEED is giving him a massage (yes, the bag has little arms and hands now). (wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxers) is frustrated as he looks at his BILLS. THE BAG OF WEED (wearing a pink bathrobe) comes out of the kitchen holding a MUG OF Hurry up! Hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there. (beat, re: weed) Dude, look at this. It's like we went from being broke to being millionaires. Suddenly, they hear what sounds like A COYOTE'S HOWL. Just a coyote. Don't worry. That's only because they sound scary. In one on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down. (CONT'D) Now cheetahs, they're another story. The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down. Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit. They're not known for eating humans. Okay, I'll admit, that's not a good sign. But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll probably leave us alone. HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins walking directly over to HAROLD... Shhh. Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON (annoyed) I thought I told you not to take that jerky! HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins licking Harold's face in friendship. Dude, I think I have an idea. I'll tell you, but first we have to get really high. Kumar opens the bag of weed. Pan up to the night sky for a time lapse.   We see smoke coming up from below. Pan back down... Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet. It's as good as a car. Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away. Well, we'll soon find out. (like to a snow dog) Mush! Mush! Both! I'm sorry! You've been out cold for the past half-hour! I figured that maybe if I did some gay shit you'd wake up. HAROLD wipes his face with his sleeve. He then gets up-- he sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves. It ran away. But forget about that. I have some bad news and some worse news. I checked out some road signs. The cheetah took us in the wrong direction. Your laptop is completely destroyed. Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag, broken in pieces. It smashed against a tree when you fell off the cheetah. Well, the laptop really only effects you. Whereas the White Castle situation effects both of us equally. Don't worry, dude. Your laptop's insured. Exactly. First, we'll take a cab over to White Castle, then we'll... Come on, Rold! You can get that shit done in a couple hours. We can't quit now! Fine...We'll find a pay phone and get a cab back to your office. Harold, furious and almost in tears, simply nods ""yes."" (pointing) Look, there's a Krispee Kreme.     We'll call from there. Oh great.     Here we go again. COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS are hacky-sacking in the parking lot. Their skateboards are sitting nearby. (to Rold) Fucking asshole. Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and points... What?    A chocolate cream filled? Are you saying what I think you're saying? Yes!    I knew you had it in you! Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table... Is that Cindy Kim? Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein. Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are ""an item."" You should have boned her when you had the chance. Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold. (pissed off, but powerless) Fuck! I'm so sick of their bullshit! Your lead? Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads towards the YELLOW JEEP at a brisk pace. KUMAR follows. What the hell are you doing?! This is your plan? (laughing) Hey, slow down to like 25 mph, so they think they have a chance to catch up. (in thick Indian Accent) Thank you, come again! Harold guns it-- leaving Cole and the Punks in the dust. Victory is sweet! Nice job, Roldy! Wait.   Do you smell that? KUMAR keeps sniffing. He turns around to the back seat. He reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. It's a WHITE CASTLE bag. He pours out the contents and we see EMPTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER CARTONS fall onto Kumar's lap. Those assholes got to have White Castle?! Don't worry . Forget about that. We have a car now. We're back in the game. Pretty soon we'll be eating our own White Castle. Want me to drive? Those guys are fucking posers! Dude, we're almost there! Oh shit! KUMAR turns around and sees the police car behind them. What are you doing?! Buckle up? Kumar buckles his seat belt.   HAROLD MAKES A SHARP TURN... Where the hell are we going?! It's a good thing I have an empty stomach, or else I'd puke right now! (pointing) Rold! Look out there! Not necessarily. KUMAR walks over to the JEEP and points to the HANG-GLIDER... Dude, it's okay. I used to hang-glide with my dad all the time when I was kid. I know how to do it. We did it on our trips   to India. I swear. I know exactly    what I'm doing. I've even done it with   two people at the same time. My brother    and I did it. You think this just about the burgers, huh? Well, let me tell you-- it's about far more than that. KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The scene is very picturesque... Our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very, very hungry. And they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals. A land where their kids could study and get into good colleges. A land filled with hamburger stands. And not just one type of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with different sizes, toppings, and condiments. That land was America. (turning to Rold) You think this is just about the burgers? No. This is about achieving what our parents set out for. This is about the pursuit of happiness. This is about the American dream. KUMAR walks over to HAROLD. And so we've reached this point. The point which all men eventually have to face. The point of no return. (beat) We can stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to White Castle. Or we can take the hang-glider and make our leap towards freedom. I leave the decision up to you. From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are getting closer. Harold turns back, facing Kumar... Grab onto the end of the bars and hold on tight. HAROLD does as he's told. They are both holding onto the bars (Harold behind Kumar). Okay. Here's how this is gonna work. On the count of three, we're gonna run to the edge of the cliff. When I say ""jump,"" launch yourself forward as if you were diving into a pool, got it? Don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine. Are you ready? HAROLD's too nervous to speak.   KUMAR gets into position. Okay, here goes. One...two...three! HAROLD and KUMAR START RUNNING TOWARDS THE CLIFF. Good job, Rold! Keep running! Rold, there's something I gotta tell you. I've never hang-glided before.  Dude, it's working! Hey, how else was I gonna convince you to jump off a cliff? We're not low. They continue gliding though the sky for a while... Yeah? Uh...well...I guess it's just gonna go down at some point. Why do you ask? Oh shit! HAROLD AND KUMAR FLY RIGHT INTO THE CROWS.   Numerous birds collide with their faces... We're gonna die! We're gonna die! We're gonna live! Ha! Ha! We're gonna live! (beat) You see, Rold? That wasn't so bad. Stop...I...can't...breathe... Rold... (pointing) Rold...look! We made it, dude. Same.    Only make mine Diet Cokes. You don't have money?! Shit, I gave all mine to that asshole at Princeton! Fuck that hippie fuck! This can't be happening! We're so close and we're fucking broke! What are you doing here? Do you realize what we had to go through after you stole the car? Dude, we're here. Isn't it great? Hey, look! KUMAR points to a TV in the corner of the restaurant.    On the screen we see A MORNING NEWS SHOW. Wait...let's do it together. It was the best meal of my life. Dude, you know what? I think I may actually go to my interview today. Yeah. You know, my whole life I've been afraid being just another nerdy Indian guy turned doctor. Well, tonight got me thinking... There are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine... HAROLD pretends to be listening to KUMAR-- BUT HE IS MORE FOCUSED ON BILLY AND J.D., who get out of the car with their women and start walking towards the front door. Like having boils all over your face. Or dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through. Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night. Somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick Harris, I realized that I've always wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been too scared to admit it. KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention... Hey, Rold, are you listening to me?   I'm having a major epiphany here. Way to go, Rold! Where the hell did that come from? No shit! I guess you're worthwhile after all. So those dudes have gonorrhea? What's the rush? There's plenty of time before my interview. Good luck, dude. KUMAR stands behind, while HAROLD approaches MARIA'S door. Dude...we gotta go! To Amsterdam! We can pack up right now and take the next plane. Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule it. He won't have a problem, as long as I'm taking it seriously for a change. Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria! For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is the kiss of death. There are gonna be suave, sophisticated guys all over her. By the time she gets back, she may not be available. Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying. Hey, Rold!   Wait! You do realize what's legal in Amsterdam, right?"
1,harold_kumar_white_castle,HAROLD,"(confused) But aren't you supposed to... Uh...okay...no problem... BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk. Fuck. I'm not gonna be able to partake in our usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta stay late at the office. I know, but I gotta get this work done. (O.S.) Listen, I'd love to go home, but... Yes!   Right in front... Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND. The jeep is loaded with ""alternative"" stickers, and has a KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof. Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car. (frustrated, to himself) Those assholes. The driver, COLE (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud mouth), puts down his window... COLE is joined in the jeep with his EXTREME SPORTS PUNK FRIENDS, who all laugh at Harold. Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous. and MARIA are standing silently as the elevator goes up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak... So Maria, what's been going on? My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change. (deadpan) Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And the guy next to me still smells like crap. But a man can dream, right? So what are you up to tonight? (disappointed) Really? (playful) That sounds awful. Harold laughs, as does Maria.    They smile at each other... Well, if you want some company, maybe you could sit on your ass at my place. and MARIA stand silently while the elevator goes up. It's clear Harold wants to say something, but he doesn't have the courage. They reach their floor and exit the elevator. Bye. Kumar? Kumar? Kumar, what the hell are you doing! Why aren't you doing this in your room! I'm gonna puke. Get your clothes on. Are those my scissors? Oh my God!     I trim my nose hair with those!  (O.C.) Other than my roommate's boney ass? (calling out) One of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight. Kumar walks back into Harold's room... If by ""go fuck yourself"" you mean ""no problem sir"" then yes, he got the message loud and clear. KUMAR shakes his head in disgust... No.   I got a lot of work to finish. Kumar shuts Harold's laptop. One joint. Don't you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously? At some point your dad's gonna get really pissed. Well, then what are you going to do? Sounds like a plan. takes the first hit off the blunt. He nods to Kumar, as if to say ""that's good shit."" Kumar takes the blunt from Harold and inhales... Nice.   Sixteen Candles is on. Oh come on. It's a John Hughes movie! It's a classic! It's a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved... We're so high right now. I don't know about you, but I'm hungry as balls. What about KFC? and KUMAR exit their apartment. You're sure you know how to get there?   I haven't been to White Castle in ages. and KUMAR walk into an apartment that looks almost identical to theirs. (Instead of a ""BILLY MADISON"" poster, there's one of ""HAPPY GILMORE."") Is that all you Jews ever think about? Tits? presses the ""down"" button. KUMAR notices that Harold has his LAPTOP BAG on his shoulder... You're driving. I'm gonna try to get some of my work done in the car. Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty. Why don't you just run back and get it? I'm not worthwhile. It doesn't matter. The only girls interested in me are girls I have no interest in. Like Cindy Kim. God, she invites me to everything. Why do I have to be the catcher? Don't even start. Of course he's gay! You remember in the first Star Wars when he was like... (in a gay C3PO voice) ""Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel soooo good!"" Kumar laughs. I don't have anymore change. No.   I don't like breaking the law. Harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on. Just hold on. I'll walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened. The honking continues as HAROLD starts to open the door... Are you crazy? Oh shit, we're dead! Harold throws the joint out the window. (paranoid/looking back) You just tore out of there! The cops are gonna catch us! Take this exit! and KUMAR drive through the dangerous streets of Newark. They're very quiet, until Kumar breaks the silence. Look, I get a little paranoid sometimes. Maybe it's not as bad as they say.    It's probably just a bunch of hype. They look out the window and see another ASIAN and INDIAN guy (Daniel and Shankar) walking down the street. Suddenly, THREE HOODS jump out from an alley and start beating the living shit out of Daniel and Shankar. Kumar gives Harold a dirty look. Let's get the hell out of here. KUMAR continues driving. He makes a turn. All of a sudden, he stops short, causing he and HAROLD to jerk forward quickly. What the... Dude, we are NOT driving through that basketball game! Forget about it. No way. Turn the car around. For some reason, I don't think this is the same thing. Don't! The BASKETBALL PLAYERS slowly begin moving aside. Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us. Look at him! The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN has an ESPECIALLY ANGRY FACE. That was close, dude. Yes!    Thank God! I'm starving! and KUMAR are looking for the White Castle... Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like twenty of those burgers. God, where the hell is this place? There's the multiplex! What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That doesn't look like a White Castle to me! Are you sure? I don't know. Should we just eat here? Kumar, I have a shitload of work to finish. And you have that med school interview in the morning. Let's do it. Agreed. Why? Oh no.    I'm not seeing Cindy. She calls me. Then she rambles on about her East Asian Students club or whatever. You know, yellow on the outside, white on the inside. Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us. No, forget it. I'm not seeing Cindy Kim. is sitting on a bed, next to CINDY KIM (very cute, prim and proper, Korean girl). Sitting on the floor are A DOZEN ASIAN STUDENTS-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy clothes, etc). Harold is kind of creeped out by them. (unenthusiastic) Yeah. Me too. Uh, yeah.    They were...nice. Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to Cindy. ""Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?"" Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while... (to Kenneth) Uh, yes? Yeah, I'm a junior analyst. Yes? What it's like being an investment banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's pretty... HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian students. He can't bear to tell them the truth... ...awesome? All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other. As for the recommendation, I may be able to make a call or two... CINDY looks at her watch... Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait for Kumar... Nice. CINDY grabs HAROLD's hand and drags him away. (to Kumar) Let's go to the party for a little while. Look, what do you want me to say?     I was under pressure. and KUMAR try to decide where to hide. Shit!    What if he finds us? (whispering) Ew...gross. CLARISSA runs into STALL NUMBER ONE and shuts the door. The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to look over at that stall. (whispering) Shit!  Oh, come on, you always exaggerate.    We weren't gonna get laid. I know Cindy's cute, it's just... Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end up with Cindy anyway. It's just more practical. Now can we drop this and get our asses to White Castle? Now what are you doing? Do you even know where you're going? We better.                                                      It starts to rain... Shit, now it's raining. Look, I'm completely on edge right now,                         okay? After all the shit we've been                             through tonight, I don't know how much more of this I can take.  Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have rabies now or something! Oh, that's not good! KUMAR Shit!!!                                Shit!!! KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, breathing heavily. They watch nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins walking over to them. Uh-oh. KUMAR rolls down his window.         The DRIVER peers inside... (feeling his neck) We haven't gotten there yet.   I think I got rabies, though. Will you stop it? I'm feeling very woozy. I may have to go to the hospital. I don't have rabies. Kumar stands up quickly. Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come to the hospital. Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches. Wow. So I guess you're going to med school after all, huh? (extremely confused) But...you just hugged him... and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks) walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway... If we get caught, you're taking the blame. This wasn't my idea. (whispering to Kumar) What the hell's going on here? Oh shit!   This guy's gonna die!!! Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all wrong. We're not doc... KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth. I'm telling you. That was amazing!    Even your dad would've been impressed! This is perfect! We're back on the road. We have directions now. The rain let up.                 And guess what... clicks on the ""SAVE"" option on his laptop... I'm officially done with my work. (beat) I'm telling you, things are finally starting to go our way. While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his surroundings and notices something... Holy shit. No way.    Forget about it.   Just drive. Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his undivided attention. Stop it. Let's just go! KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN. What are you doing?! You asshole! My car's probably all scratched up now! I told you I didn't want to speak to her! (composing himself) Whatever. Let's jut get back on the highway. examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby. There's not another car in site. Godammit. You know how to change a flat? Where's my spare tire? Shit, where the hell is it? Kumar suddenly remembers... What bridge? What the hell are you talking about? Your bad?   What are the hell are we gonna do now?! Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES. Thanks for helping us out. KUMAR Uh...Yeah.                        Sure, he's great. So where exactly are we going? (whispering) Will you shut up? He's right next to me! He can hear you! KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL. (whispering) What's the matter with you? You think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying? He's two feet away from us. He can hear this entire conversation. He can hear me talking right now. (with laptop in tow) and KUMAR stand by their car, as FREAK SHOW brings out some tools and a new tire from his house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere. He couldn't have said that. Who cares? You've seen Freak Show. What do you think his wife is gonna look like? and KUMAR walk inside and see THE HOTTEST CHICK OF ALL TIME (LIANE) walk out of the kitchen. She is dressed Daisy Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest. Okay. It's official.     We've entered the Twilight Zone. She's not ugly. LIANE comes in with the pitcher of lemonade.    She pours them drinks and hands them the glasses... Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak Show...end up with a woman like yourself? Wait a second-- what about Freak Show...and this whole Christian thing you guys have going on? No, I just... Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window, where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy. Nevermind. (to Kumar, swinging his hand) Okay, rock, paper, scissors... Huh? Sorry, no thank you. Forget it! I don't want our balls rubbing against each other. No way! KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation... Okay, let's do that. Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts. Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold starts to massage her chest. AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a particularly threatening TIRE-IRON... (scared shitless) Uhh...you said outside that we can have sex with her! FREAK SHOW runs over to HAROLD and grabs him by the collar! and KUMAR burst out the front door and run towards their car. They get in and peel out as fast as they can. Agreed. And get chopped to bits?     Are you crazy? Kumar pulls over to the side of the road... Fuck that! It's my car! We're not picking up a hitchhiker! The back door opens and Neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car. (to Neil) Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil Patrick Harris? Hey, you don't know how to get back on the highway, do you? Huh? and KUMAR get out of the car.   NEIL is still in the backseat. The car is still running. We'll be right back, Neil. NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start walking over to the CONVENIENCE STORE. What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why's he so horny? (upset) Oh shit. These idiots. Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them... and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests... Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here? The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders. (to Kumar) Huh?   Oh, good. Somebody should do something. (to Kumar) I didn't mean you should do something. Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face. Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior. It's a tense moment. Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up. Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard, this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling... and KUMAR walk back towards their car... Kumar-- you okay? (calm) Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car?  Why the hell did you leave the keys in the car?! This is all your fault! This whole fucking night! You know I leased that car! They're gonna make me pay for it! Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store. I'm going to call the police!   I don't want to talk to you anymore! Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face. ""Extremes"" all around! I'm not speaking to you. Harold waits for the ""DON'T WALK"" sign to change. It doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE ""WALK"" BUTTON REPEATEDLY. Thank you, Mr. Wizard. HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't change, he begins pressing the button again. Jesus Christ! When are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency? The ""DON'T WALK"" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the left and then to the right. The street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide. It'll change in a second. They stand there for another ten seconds.   It doesn't change. Alright fine. You want me to cross? I'll cross. Just leave me alone! Harold starts walking angrily across the street. Shit! Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as OFFICER PALUMBO (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the car and walks over to them... (looking at cop's name- tag) Good evening. Is there a problem, Officer...Palumbo? Yes. Yes I have. I'm so sorry. I promise I'll never do it again. (stepping in front of Kumar) Let me apologize for my friend. I promise I will pay the fine. But actually, I'm glad you're here. You know the TV show Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie Howser just stole my car and... Kumar, shut up... Harold. Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo. Thank you. OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk away. Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't... Oh shit. (calling out) Hey, are you gonna do something about my car? Hello? Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE ASSHOLE and his MOM. The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check. Can I at least give you my car's licence plate number? Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio... So what are you in here for? Come on.   Seriously. TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation. Holy shit.   What did you do? That fucking blows! Tarik nods and continues reading his book.    Harold sees that Tarik is remarkably relaxed. I don't understand how you're able to be so calm about all this. Assaulting an officer. No. I actually did hit the cop. But only because I was trying to hit my friend. Well, ex-friend. That was strange. Suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a VENTILATION SHAFT on the ceiling, above one of the officer's desks. What the hell was that? (shouting out) Kumar?! What the fuck are you doing?! No, they...   Wait a second, did you... Jesus Christ! What did you do that for?! Forget it! I don't want to get in any more trouble! I'm already in here because of you! Well, I never got your car stolen! Hey asshole, I'm in jail! Don't bitch to me about your problems! Just leave me alone. I don't want your help. How the hell should I know? Jesus Christ. Tarik shakes his head. And become a fugitive? Are you nuts? The guy has all my information. Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report, Harold's I.D., and his laptop. Fine.    Hurry up. Kumar smiles.   He begins searching for a key. Kumar, hurry the fuck up! Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple keys, when he suddenly smells something... Kumar?...Kumar! Kumar can't hear Harold. He's in a trance. We begin to hear a romantic song as Kumar stares lovingly at the BAG OF WEED... What the hell are you... Suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room, pushing a black man wearing pajamas (NATHANIEL BANKS). Nathaniel seems very gentle. He's even wearing a turtleneck sweater. (to Kumar) Wait-- shouldn't we do something about this? and KUMAR (still clinging to the weed) burst out the door and run down the steps. They race through the street and start heading towards a FOREST. and KUMAR have stopped running.   They start catching their breath. Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking mad house! Thanks for getting me out of there, dude. What was that? Aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes? We're gonna die. We're gonna die. (whispering) This isn't working. (eyes closed, screaming) He likes me. Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up... What is it? Has it come to this?    Are we really gonna ride this cheetah? This is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done. HAROLD puts his arms around KUMAR to hold on.    Kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt... Dude, am I just really high or is this is actually working?! This is great! We'll be at White Castle in no... I love you, Maria. MARIA gets up and runs away. HAROLD playfully chases her. Maria runs over to a FRENCH FRY TREE. SHE PLUCKS A COUPLE wakes up to find KUMAR LICKING HIS FACE.   HAROLD JUMPS What the hell are you doing?!!! What happened to the cheetah? (nervous) Tell me the worse news first. That sucks.    What's the bad news?  Why the hell didn't you say that THAT was the ""worse news""? Oh no! No! No! It's not that! All my work was saved in there! Now I gotta go back to the office and re-do everything! Forget White Castle.   There's no time! 'S CAR AIRBORNE AS IT SCALES A HILL!    THE CAR LANDS, Look! Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside, sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down... Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT. HAROLD and KUMAR watch through the window longingly... (yearning) I want that. No.  I want that feeling. (beat) The feeling that comes over a man when he finally gets exactly what he desires. (beat) I NEED that feeling. We gotta go to White Castle. KUMAR gives HAROLD a hug. (to Cole) Hey, why don't you just leave us alone? Nothing. Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee Kreme entrance. Kumar follows. In the background Cole and the Punks are laughing about what a ""pussy"" Harold is. (totally calm) Don't worry. The universe tends to unfold as it should. Kumar gives a ""What the fuck is he talking about?"" look. Besides, I have a plan.   Follow my lead... I'm stealing their car. It's working isn't it? and KUMAR are laughing and slapping five. I had to do something. KUMAR begins sniffing something in the air... This world is so unfair. No. I've got everything under control. We should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done after our feast. Just find us some tunes. A tape is resting in the tape deck.   KUMAR pushes it in... HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other amazed that COLE has some lame chick song on his tape. and KUMAR are still singing... All of a sudden, HAROLD and KUMAR hear a POLICE SIREN. looks determined as he puts the pedal to the metal. I'm not going back to jail!     We've come too far! Now buckle up. Just hold on! Don't worry. We're gonna make it. Everything's gonna be... KUMAR Shit!                               Fuck! Oh shit!   We're trapped! Kumar notices something... No. No way. Not a chance.       I'd rather turn myself in than die. You hang-glided? I don't remember that. No, Kumar. I'm not risking my life over a bunch of hamburgers. KUMAR walks over to HAROLD and stares him in the eye... I hate you, Kumar. Hurry up...they're almost here! (nervous) I think so.  KUMAR Oh my God!    Oh my God!   Oh my God! I can't believe you lied to me! Dude, we're so high right now. Hey, Kumar? How are we gonna get down? That's a great answer. Made me feel really comfortable. Thanks a lot. KUMAR looks down as they fly over a playground. Is it a problem if we fly into birds? Because we're about to! KUMAR looks up and sees at least A HUNDRED CROWS FLYING Ahhhh!   My eyes! Don't peck out my eyes! I hate you!   I hate you so much! (breathing heavily) That's it...I'm gonna kill you... That's the point! You're gonna die! I want thirty slyders. I want five french fries. I want four large Cherry cokes. Hey...hey...hey...where's my money?! Where's my fucking car you prick! Thanks, I guess. NEIL hands them some cash... (concerned) What happened to the car? Where are you going? I know. I can't believe we made it. AND we got the car back! If we can just get out of here in a half hour, I can get back to my office and get the work done. (to Kumar) Hey, good for those black guys! and KUMAR have put three tables together, on which we see SIXTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGERS-- EACH ONE STEAMING HOT. TWO GOOD-LOOKING GUYS (JON and HAYDEN) stare at Harold and           Kumar's orders, amazed by their size. They then look at              their own orders and realize how worthless they are.                 HAROLD and KUMAR are sitting across from one another, looking at the smorgasbord in front of them. HAROLD IS ABOUT TO DIG and KUMAR have finished their meals. They both look full and satisfied. Harold takes one last sip of his soda. Oh...that hit the spot. Mine too. The two of them sit there, looking at all the empty containers and wrappers. After a long pause of silence, KUMAR speaks... Seriously? (not paying attention) Uh-huh. I'll be right back... At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On the other hand, has a sweet RENEE ZELLWEGER quality about her. She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple... (O.S.) What the fuck is going on here? BILLY turns around and sees HAROLD... Never mind me. What are you doing here? I thought you and J.D. were busy all night with ""clients."" Isn't that why I had to do YOUR work? Back off, cock boy! What I have to say to him goes double for you! KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it. Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback. Tell him what? That I'm your work horse! That you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh? J.D. is stunned.   Now he's a little nervous. No, YOU don't understand. I'm not doing your work anymore. And I'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore. TRACI and ZOE hear this and are freaked out.   They slowly back away from BILLY and J.D.... Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get going. See you on Monday. HAROLD leaves the RESTAURANT. KUMAR follows.     Billy and J.D. are left embarrassed and in shock. and KUMAR walk over to Harold's Infiniti... I don't know. Eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man. Now I'm actually looking forward to work this week. I'm not worthless. Beats me. (beat) Now, come on, let's get going. I have some unfinished business to take care of. They both get into the car (Harold gets in the driver's side). The car zooms out... 'S WHITE INFINITI PULLS INTO TO A SPACE RIGHT IN FRONT (lying) Oh...uh...nothing...wrong room. (grossed out/depressed) Look, I really don't need to hear it. I guess I just made a mistake. Sorry for interrupting you guys... Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY. Kumar feels sorry for his friend. Just then, Luis leans his head out the door... Huh? Oh!    Maria's brother! Actually, I'm Kor...wait a second-- she talks about me? A HOT BLACK CHICK (AISHA), wearing only a bra and g-string, walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him... Uh, no thanks. I'd rather do it in person. Huh?   Where? What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? What about your interview with the med school guy? She's coming back in ten days!

LIANE   leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she turns   on a record player, which starts playing a CREEPY SONG ABOUT   JESUS CHRIST. HAROLD and KUMAR look around the house. There   are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with Freak   Show and Liane's wedding picture... Oh, never been better.    We love each other very much. KUMAR looks disappointed.    HAROLD, however, is intrigued... Well, I met him at choir practice `bout four years ago. Freak Show was very shy back then-- you know, because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck. But he had the most amazing voice -- like a baby canary. Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- ""are we talking about the same Freakshow?"" Well, one day after Easter service, I told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and he just mustered up some courage and asked me out. The rest is history. And we've been in love ever since. HAROLD ponders this for a moment.    He and KUMAR begin drinking their lemonade. So you boys gonna fuck me or what? HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold. (a little offended) Oh, so just because we're passionate about our Lord, you assume we don't know how to have a good time? Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do me at the same time. Come on.   Give me the double stuff. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused. I want you both inside me simultaneously. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE... However you want to do it. Well...okay. (to Harold) Can you help me with this...? Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar, who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts. (to Harold, re: breasts) Do you want to play with them? Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane..."
5,harold_kumar_white_castle,HIPPIE ASSHOLE,"Heeey, Man. Lookin' to toke up? KUMAR breathes a sigh of relief... Yo, man!   Not cool! This is my baby, man! That'll be eighty bucks. I'm not your bro...bro. And if you feel like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy it. That's cool with me. I can find lots of people who want to get high. I can smoke it myself, man. One who understands the concept of supply and demand, dude. Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off. He takes out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole. (laughing like a prick) Dumbass. Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE, BLUE EYES, BIG BREASTS, BRITISH ACCENTS) approach carrying take-out bags. They see KUMAR and the Hippie Asshole making their deal. (to the Twins) Yeah. Wanna come back to my place? (butting in) Hey, my poetry isn't lame! It's actually quite good. The girls clearly aren't convinced. The ignore him and turn to Kumar. Hippie Asshole is oblivious to the fact he's not part of the crowd. Yeah, see you there. THE TWINS walk away. Kumar's excited. Hippie Asshole tries to pound fists with Kumar like they're all of a sudden friends. Kumar snubs him and runs off. Not cool, man. Uh, yeah. There's like, two hundred of them in this dorm. (to himself, but audible) `Tard. Cindy can't help but feel a little stupid. (to himself) Where the hell is 109, man? Harold is about to avoid him, but Kumar grabs Harold close and the two of them BASH INTO THE Hippie Asshole-- KNOCKING (reaching for the bag) Aw, dude! Don't take it! It's mine! He continues to protest as SECURITY GUARD #2 holds him down. 'S MOM Well, thank you for being so understanding about Bradley. I promise you he won't ever do it again. (shaken) Mom-- please take me home... The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a frightened child. Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on Harold... Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars..."
7,harold_kumar_white_castle,TARIK,"For being black. I am serious. You wanna know what happened? Harold nods. I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble, and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore, since I'm black, it was probably me, right? Harold shrugs his shoulders. Well that was the logic the cop used. I told him I haven't even been to Newark in months. Then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest. I said, ""Hey, I'm not resisting anything."" So he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me, telling me to stop resisting. I kept saying, ""I understand that I'm under arrest. Please stop beating me."" But that didn't work. Then another cop showed up. Then another. When it was all said and done, it took nine cops to bring me in here. Son, I'm fat. I'm black. I can't dance. And I have two gay fathers. I've had people messing with me my whole life. (beat) I learned a long time ago, there's no point in getting all riled up every time a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time. Because in the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should. So what are you in here for? They tried to pin that shit on you too? Hey, I'm trying to read here. What?     Oh, not again! The cops handcuff Nathaniel to the leg of a desk, and run over to the jail cell, ignoring Kumar and the weed. I'm not trying to escape!        Look at me, I'm sitting down! They turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm into the room. Harold stands back, confused. Tarik leans against the wall, ready to be handcuffed. The cops grab him and throw him down against the bed. What happened last night was a complete moral travesty. My family and I are outraged and will not settle for anything less than justice..."
9,harold_kumar_white_castle,OFFICER PALUMBO,"Is there a problem? Ever hear of jaywalking? Yeah, like I give a fuck. I'm writing you up a ticket. OFFICER PALUMBO begins writing a ticket.    Kumar walks over, flabbergasted... (to Kumar, unthreatened) Who the fuck are you, shitwad? Pipe down and give me your ID. (to Kumar) Yeah, that's not the best tone to use on a cop who could bust your ass. Yeah, Koo-mar. Bust your ass. (to Harold) What's with that name -- Koo-mar -- with like three o's and shit. What happened to good old fashioned American names like Dave, Jim... Harold points to his ID. Yes. Harold. That's a great name.    You should be proud of that name, son. As you were, ladies. Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it. Hey, hands down! No sudden moves! Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with Palumbo improvising little responses. Thanks, Mrs. Ogelthorpe. Your donation to our Police Charity is very appreciated. Oh, I'm sure he won't. Not after the talk we had, right Brad? Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look. Finally, some action! I'm going! Another cop, OFFICER MARTONE, gets up... (to Nathaniel) You thought you could get away with this, huh? (re: Tarik) Shit! Jackson's trying to escape! Tarik looks up from his book... Stop trying to escape! I'm not racist! This is bullshit! If those black bastards think they're gonna get away with this, they've got another thing coming! Me and my white buddies are gonna [bleep] them up! Officer Palumbo gets shoved forcefully into the back of a police car. Harold and Kumar enjoy this."

It wasn't him. No. In my house, he tried to get me to go into the basement with him. 55. Shut up Richie. It wasn't just him. I saw this other... I don't know. Yes.

Eddie. We tried, we can't get down stairs. Do you see anything you could use to climb out? What do we do? Ah, fuck! Who know what's going on. BEVERLY I think it's pretty obvious.      Derry's not just haunted, it's cursed. Exactly. No one listened to him like no one listens to us. And unless we do something, ""IT's"" never going to stop. We can kill it. I don't think that's a choice, Stan. ""IT"" knows we know. We hurt it. It's going to want to hurt us back. We're all scared. That's what it feeds off of. I heard the clown tell Eddie as much. Our only defense is to stick together. 96. Hey. Why? To scream at each other more? 97. And Georgie right? You, dad, and Georgie. No. You stop. I hate   it. Tip toeing around you guys like   I don't exist. Like I'm the one who   died and the only one who's still   here is Ge-- What do you care? At least she heard me. I miss Georgie, too. Do you? Because it seems like every adult in this town is blind to what's really happening, blind to what any of us kids are going through. C'mon, clown. Show your ugly face! I'll stick another firecracker in it for Georgie. Blow your whole stupid head off. Send you back to wherever a creeper like you comes from. Where are you!? (O.S.) Eddie? Eddie you there? (O.S.) Eddie? I know where to find-- The sewers. ""IT."" Whenever it shows up, there's always water around. The storm drain where Georgie died. The leak in my room. Beverly's sink. I'll bet if you trace every terrible event in Derry you'll find the same thing. Water. With the Penobscot river on one side and Kenduskeag canal cutting through it's impossible to escape. Shit, Stan's bar mitzvah.   I almost forgot. You are now. Let's go! Bev. You okay? 109. What?   What did he do Beverly? Not someone. ""IT"". The sewers. Me and Mike figured it out. That's how it gets around. That's where it lives. 112. The sewers. We go in. All of us. Get rid of ""IT"" before ""IT"" gets rid of us, one by one. It doesn't know what to do when all of us are together, you have to believe me. C'mon! We need to protect each other Stan. The seven of us is all we have. Together ""IT"" can't hurt us. I promise. I have faith. Just like you. (YELLING) This is our only way into Derry's original sewer system before it was sealed off and modernized. Don't look back! There's suppose to be a tunnel here. The last tunnel that's shown on the map. Keep moving! Don't jiggle it too much, whatever you do. Victor. It doesn't matter what it calls itself. What matters is it's afraid to show us what it really is. Which means we can beat it. Beverly, wait-! We all here? Guys, the island.    Let's swim. Hurry! (CONT'D) Stan what are you doing! (CONT'D) Stan, it's us. You in there buddy? Maybe. Or just changing into something else. It's using our fears against us. It wants us to be afraid. We have to stick together, to help each other against that kind of fear you only have when you're alone. Alright? (CONT'D) Ready? 124. (CONT'D) My turn. I'm not afraid of you, clown. Guys? (CONT'D) Ahhhh! (CONT'D) Come out from the dark then. Come out from behind that stupid mask and show me what you really are. C'mon! I'm sorry, Georgie. You're not Georgie. 127. No!   I have to think. No. (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't go out there with you. I'm sorry I was sick. Hairspray. We've got to get out of here. 129. We'll get out. C'mon. No. I don't know-- Swear, guys.

But we got a project we're working on out there. Whoa, what's with the history project, Benny-boy? EDDIE What are you, the ""Reading      He's a regular Jordy Laforge. Rainbow""? The entire town? (TO STAN) Aren't you supposed to be Jewish? 51. Shit, maybe we could get Derry on Unsolved Mysteries! It's summer, dorkus. If you're gonna kill time, do it right. 52. Eddie? Will you stop with the grey water shit. You make it seem like any water we get in is like swimming in an out-house. What are you waiting for? Why don't you get in you pussy? I thought so. Boys, you're ruining my sunbathing vibes with all this chitter chatter. We already know you're crazy, Will. No judgement here. That wasn't Georgie, that was your neighborhood sex offender making a house call. I take it back. I'm judging all of you and you are all friggin' wackos. Can you give me an indicator of what I'm about to walk into? I hope it's Ed McMahon and I've just won publishers clearing house 10 million dollar sweepstakes. But if it is, you really didn't have to go through so much trouble, you could have just brought Ed to the quarry. It's like someone slaughtered a pig in here. Or a parent. All I'm saying is maybe there's some weirdo going around Derry dressed as a clown. You know, like the Joker in a ""Dark Knight"" comic. Some whack job who likes to dress up and kidnap kids. I don't know. Who knows how crazy people do things, right? What happened, homeschool? Benny-boy, don't forget the ranch dressing. (mimicking Paul Hogan) You call that a firecracker?    This is a firecracker. What? Getting laiiiid. Cuz blood always freaks a girl out. I didn't need to know that. 73. Ironic right? Something that's suppose to make kids laugh, actually being super freaky. Home school. When do you ever think anything is a good idea? You want to swim?! If we die here I just want to say that fight was friggin' awesome. Don't count your chickens. 81. (TO STAN) Why do you keep using our teams, guy? I'm not going up there. Whatever it is, we don't want to go back in there. You gotta a better idea? We were attacked, Mrs. K. Travis BOWERS AND-- Well, that went well. Welcome to the club, kid. The point of telling us was? STAN I don't know, man.   That         Lumberjack. FLAPJACK STORY-- Whatevs. It sounds like bunk to me. Didn't the guy who wrote this go insane or something? Okay Schwarzenegger twins, simmer down. We can't even free Eddie from ""mom jail"" let alone take down some freaky shape-shifter with a mind- meld on all the adults of Derry. However, I do believe we could sell this story to ""Tales from the crypt."" Yeah well, the only time I've been spooked is when I'm with you jokers. I'm thinking I might be safer at home. At least I know my parents won't try to kill me. (through his teeth) Way to make an entry, Eddie-bear. What do you mean your dad attacked you? Whoa whoa whoa. You don't really MEAN-- And friggin do what?   In this storm? I hope your schlong grew those 12 inches cuz you're gonna need it. Happy bar mitzvah, Jason. Bet you didn't put this sucker on your gift list. Uh, guys! Something tells me we're not in Derry anymore. You still afraid of a little grey water? Mind equals blown right now. What? The worst and only bar mitzvah party you will ever have. And that's supposed to rally us, Will? I'm taking this fucker out. It's miller ti-- Shit! Now can we celebrate? I had to mow like five hundred lawns. Stan smoked the clippings."
9,it,EDDIE,"So how's it work? The ceremony. Your Bar Mitzvah. Marie Claire. 10. Jesus, she's still here? They're not going to find him. Hi Mom. Yes, ma. Bye ma. paces the embankment with their shoes and socks and backpacks. He looks anxious. No way. There's sixty million diseases in that stream. It's gray water. Tell `em Will. Your dad works for the public works. Sewer water. Pee and poop. I'm telling you guys you're splashing around in Derry's toilet. What's the big deal? It's just a sneaker. Shit. This isn't good, guys. This seriously isn't good. We should go. Guys-- Guys stop. We're gonna get in trouble. I don't know. Disturbing evidence. Contaminating a scene. We should just mark where we found the shoe and leave an anonymous note to Chief Borton. My mom would have a major cow if she knew I was playing down here, I kid you not. That's not funny, Richie. That's so not funny. Will, please. Fine. You guys can do what you want but I'm going. I have no interest in seeing the muddy mangled body of SOME-- Woah, that's a lot of money. Will? You crazy? My mom finds out I bought this stuff for myself I'll have to spend the whole weekend in the emergency room getting x-rayed. My EpiPen Jr.? I don't spaz. Those are allergic reactions. Life threatening allergic reactions. I DON'T-- 34. Thanks, Mr. Keene.   That one was a real shit kicker. Shit Stan, what happened to you? You look like you've seen a ghost. Yeah. I think he means you, Big Ben. Guys, you think whoever kidnapped Dorsey might of, I dunno... got Georgie too? (CONT'D) Will's little brother. Or was. Before your time. What did he say? Later days. Hey, isn't that where Will's brother, Georgie- Screw that. Ben, with those cuts you have on your chest, I'm not sure if getting in this water- Haunted how? Like.   In your dreams? Oh God. Oh God. There was a lot of blood. Only us kids can see it. ""IT."" 72. On what? It makes sense though. If it's killing kids. A clown is the perfect cover. They're going to cream him. I don't think that's a good idea. Really guys, there has to be another option. I'm serious. This house-- (TO HIMSELF) We shouldn't be here. (STILL REPEATING) We shouldn't be here. We shouldn't be here! There's something I didn't tell you guys. This house. I saw something here once. I thought it was just my mind playing tricks, but now I know... (CONT'D) I saw ""IT."" (whispering in fright) It's here. 83. Shit. Guys, look. Guys? Get me out of here. What do you mean you can't get down stairs? I- I think I broke my arm. No. No no no. Will?     Help me! 87. Hurry, guys! (CONT'D) This isn't happening. This isn't happening. Go away! No. No.   Feels fine I guess. I'm not allowed to see them. My Mom thinks they're the reason I got hurt. She says I'm sensitive and they don't take care of me like she does. Yeah. Mom says I should always carry my Epi-pen with me, in case I ever have an episode. Not me, momma... You. He said I was never allergic until you made me start carrying around my Epi-pen. You put those allergies in my head. 108. Then why did you send my friends away? You lied to me mamma. You've been giving me medicine that's not really medicine. This is what's going to happen now. (CONT'D) I'm going out that door and you won't stop me. I'm going to my friend Stan's bar-mitzvah and when I come home you're never going to tell how weak or sick or delicate I am ever again. Guess I'm not as weak as I thought. You guys, if ""IT"" can take over Beverly's parents, why not the rest of ours? What do you mean? Wait, count you in to what? Oh my God oh my God! Dorsey's other shoe. Hurry. Don't get too close to the edge, Will. You still wear diapers at night? It's in our head. All the stuff we see. It's like the allergies my mom said I had. We make it real. BEVERLY Stan? Stan, are you okay?       Stan! Stanley, snap out of it. 123. What do you mean? Because we'll taste better. Did we kill it? MIKE I'm so cold.                      All this water. It's still going to win. Well Richie mostly."

If you're worried about Bowers and his merry band of a-holes hassling you, don't. I saw them all leave out front. You're the new kid right? I'm-- (off Ben's look) I slipped in the shower. What's your excuse? Well, see ya around Ben from sosh class. ""Get laid in the shade."" K.I.T. Yeah, Mommy? What Mommy? No.    Why? (O.S.) You consider a diversion? Your friend there. He has that thingy he always carries around in his cute little fannypack right? Yeah. For when he spazzes out. Whatever. The point is he has a track record right? Of spazzing out. I knew I shouldn't `a given him that granola. Mr. Keene! My mom doesn't like me handling needles. Not bad for a bunch of amateurs. Is s-someone there? Who are you? The bathroom! Daddy, in the BATHROOM-- No... the sink... in the sink... The sink... I was... I thought I saw a spider... Yes, sir. I'm sorry for waking you. Because you love momma? (O.C.) Too late. Have you been seeing ""things"" Will? I need to show you guys something. My Daddy will kill me if he finds out I had boys in our apartment. Sometimes he comes home for a nap. 56. My Daddy?    Mean. Like a drunk. In there. You'll see. You really see it? The sink. It came out from the sink. My parents couldn't see it. I thought I was going crazy. Or blood in my sink? I am now.    Thanks to you guys. But we're not lying. Nice stick, Richie.     How about this. I think it depends. Wow, you really don't know shit about girls do you?

Will, we need cover-- Rock, paper, scissors? It's just a scrape. What is it Eddie? What exactly did you see here, Eddie? What's happening?! We have to do something. (CONT'D) Follow me! I don't know, Richie. That can't be true.   We just saw ""IT."" We hurt it at Neibolt.   That's gotta mean something. He's just scared. My friend's party. I told ma-- No one. I know daddy.

It's-- (CONT'D) Inspiring. (EMBARRASSED) I'll try, Mrs. Starret. I'm reading about the history of this place. You know how many spooky things have-- (whispering it outloud) Your hair is winter fire, JANUARY EMBERS My heart burns there, too. You better quit, I swear. Yes! I say yes! Okay! Copy all you want! I DON'T-- Ben. Thanks for helping me. Beverly was there? And she stole this stuff for me? (CONT'D) Did she know it was for me? STAN Yes she does.                   What's going on in there? My mom gave it to me so I wouldn't be late for curfew. It's funny, `til the last week I didn't think anyone knew my name. 'S HAIKU is propped on a night stand. Oh, uh, when I first moved here I didn't have anyone to play with or anything, so I just started hanging out in the Library. I don't know. There's just a lot of that here. Been that way since the original settlers. Derry started as a logging camp before it was officially on any maps. 300 people signed the charter that made Derry Derry. A month later they all disappeared, without a trace. The people, the livestock, everything that was alive. People in neighboring settlements thought it was Indians or something but there was no sign of an attack. The only clue was a well house that was burnt down to charcoal. It was here. Right on the corner of what's now Witcham and Jackson. RICHIE I'm sorry.    I didn't-              (to Eddie) Good job numb nuts. I don't know. It was just a way to kill time, I guess. I'll go. What's grey water? Very funny, Richie. You mean how all sorts of disasters and disappearances and stuff keeps on happening here? The clown? Isn't he at work? BEVERLY Not someone.    Something.        There's like this spirit. A clown. But you adults aren't doing anything! Hey Richie. Eat a bag of dicks. Into one freaky looking clown you mean. That's the only form that seems to repeat. Beverly's right. We can't always hide from them. We need to do something. Fuck. The house. It's our only chance! , STAN, & BEVERLY Shut up, Eddie. No.   I'll go. (WHISPERING LOUDLY) Down here! (WHISPERING) You okay? Guys, uh-- The front door is right there. Eddie, what are you doing? We can't leave him alone down there. Guys, I hate to pile on bad news. The only losers in town- And that is the story of the Silver Dollar Saloon. That clown, whatever ""IT"" is, has been around Derry doing nasty things for a long long time. The Black Spot fire. The Bradley Gang massacre. All the way back to the first settlers who disappeared. STAN No, no. This is far too         I don't want to see ""it"" whacked for ""Tales.""            again. Ever. This storm is crazy.   Like the sky's gonna fall. How'd you escape? If it means protecting Beverly, count me in. Oh, fuck! Shit, ""IT"" has a name. No no no no no!   Guys!
