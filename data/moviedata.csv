190,Avengers,Nick Fury,0,how bad is it?
191,Avengers,Nick Fury,1,nasa didn't authorize selvig to test phase.
192,Avengers,Nick Fury,2,what are the energy levels now?
193,Avengers,Nick Fury,3,how long to get everyone out?
194,Avengers,Nick Fury,4,do better.
195,Avengers,Nick Fury,5,we should tell them to go back to sleep?
196,Avengers,Nick Fury,6,i need you to make sure that phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
197,Avengers,Nick Fury,7,"until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. clear out the tech below. every piece of phase 2 on a truck and gone."
198,Avengers,Nick Fury,8,"talk to me, doctor. dr. erik selvig emerges from behind the cms machine, concerned. the tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings shoot out at random."
199,Avengers,Nick Fury,9,is there anything we know for certain?
200,Avengers,Nick Fury,10,is that supposed to be funny?
201,Avengers,Nick Fury,11,how soon until you pull the plug?
202,Avengers,Nick Fury,12,"we've prepared for this, doctor. harnessing energy from space."
203,Avengers,Nick Fury,13,that can be harmful. where's barton?
204,Avengers,Nick Fury,14,"agent barton, report. barton rappels down from the catwalk. walks up to fury. they both walk around the facility in a discreet manner."
205,Avengers,Nick Fury,15,i gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
206,Avengers,Nick Fury,16,are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?
207,Avengers,Nick Fury,17,at this end?
208,Avengers,Nick Fury,18,"sir, please put down the spear! loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where fury and barton are standing and shoots out a blue exploding light towards them. barton tackles fury and they both barely miss loki's fired shot. all hell breaks. machine gun fire is shot at loki, but the bullets bounce off him like a boss. loki jumps high from the platform and attacks those firing at him. in the blink of an eye, loki takes down several guards with his knives and energy blasts from the scepter. he stops and waits to see who will attack him next. honestly, the whole lab has almost gone to shit. barton tries to stand up. loki quickly walks towards him. barton raises his gun, but loki grabs barton's hand."
209,Avengers,Nick Fury,19,
210,Avengers,Nick Fury,20,we have no quarrel with your people.
211,Avengers,Nick Fury,21,you planning to step on us?
212,Avengers,Nick Fury,22,free from what?
213,Avengers,Nick Fury,23,"yeah, you say peace, i kind of think you mean the other thing. from the vacuum chamber ceiling, tesseract's energy cloud rapidly builds into what may be an implosion."
214,Avengers,Nick Fury,24,like the pharaohs of odin.
215,Avengers,Nick Fury,25,"(through the walkie talkie) hill, do you copy?! loki and barton sharply look at agent hill."
216,Avengers,Nick Fury,26,barton is...
217,Avengers,Nick Fury,27,he's got the tesseract! track it down! the energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling.
218,Avengers,Nick Fury,28,the tesseract is with the hostile force. i have men down. hill?
219,Avengers,Nick Fury,29,sound the general call. i want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case.
220,Avengers,Nick Fury,30,"coulson, get back to base. this is a level seven. as of right now, we are at war. a beat."
221,Avengers,Nick Fury,31,"you ever been in a war, councilman? in a firefight? did you feel an overabundance of control?"
222,Avengers,Nick Fury,32,not asgard. loki.
223,Avengers,Nick Fury,33,"our intelligence says, thor is not a hostile. but he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. it's up to us."
224,Avengers,Nick Fury,34,"phase 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. we need a response team."
225,Avengers,Nick Fury,35,this isn't about the avengers.
226,Avengers,Nick Fury,36,"i'm not leaving anything to anyone. we need a response team. these people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but i believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need."
227,Avengers,Nick Fury,37,"no, it's won by soldiers."
228,Avengers,Nick Fury,38,trouble sleeping?
229,Avengers,Nick Fury,39,"then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the tape off his hands. he sits down."
230,Avengers,Nick Fury,40,we've made some mistakes along the way. some very recently.
231,Avengers,Nick Fury,41,i am.
232,Avengers,Nick Fury,42,"trying to save it. fury hands steve a file on the tesseract, along with other files on hydra's projects."
233,Avengers,Nick Fury,43,"howard stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. he thought what we think, the tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. that's something the world sorely needs."
234,Avengers,Nick Fury,44,he's called loki. he's not from around here. there's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. the world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
235,Avengers,Nick Fury,45,ten bucks says you're wrong. there's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment. steve turns and picks up a punching bag. starts walking out of the gym.
236,Avengers,Nick Fury,46,is there anything you can tell us about the tesseract that we ought to know now?
237,Avengers,Nick Fury,47,good. let's vanish.
238,Avengers,Nick Fury,48,"gentlemen. steve gives fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again. fury walks over banner and extends his hand. banner, reluctantly shakes it."
239,Avengers,Nick Fury,49,"doctor, thank you for coming."
240,Avengers,Nick Fury,50,"once we get our hands on the tesseract, you're in the clear."
241,Avengers,Nick Fury,51,how many are there?
242,Avengers,Nick Fury,52,"agent romanoff, would you show dr.banner to his laboratory, please. natasha nods and walks off, leading banner down the hall."
243,Avengers,Nick Fury,53,"captain, you're up. steve nods. leaves."
244,Avengers,Nick Fury,54,(v.o.) said anything?
245,Avengers,Nick Fury,55,"(v.o.) just get him here. we're low on time. with loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, tony and steve watch from a distance, whispering."
246,Avengers,Nick Fury,56,"in case it's unclear. you try to escape. you so much as scratch that glass. fury presses a button which opens up a hatch underneath loki's cell. loki peers as much as he can from the glass. without seeing, the sounds of gusting wind would make man shit his pants. not a god, though."
247,Avengers,Nick Fury,57,"thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. you get how that works?! fury closes the hatch. points at loki."
248,Avengers,Nick Fury,58,ant. then points at the button which would drop loki into the steel trap.
249,Avengers,Nick Fury,59,boot.
250,Avengers,Nick Fury,60,built for something a lot stronger than you.
251,Avengers,Nick Fury,61,how desperate am i? you threaten my world with war. you steal a force you can't hope to control.
252,Avengers,Nick Fury,62,(cont'd) you talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. you have made me very desperate. you might not be glad that you did.
253,Avengers,Nick Fury,63,
254,Avengers,Nick Fury,64,
255,Avengers,Nick Fury,65,"i don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. and i'd like to know how loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men i know into his personal flying monkeys."
256,Avengers,Nick Fury,66,(o.s.) war hasn't started yet.
257,Avengers,Nick Fury,67,"a lot of guys think that, until the pain stops."
258,Avengers,Nick Fury,68,i'm asking. what are you prepared to do?
259,Avengers,Nick Fury,69,then why do i feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here? thor doesn't answer.
260,Avengers,Nick Fury,70,
261,Avengers,Nick Fury,71,you're supposed to be locating the tesseract.
262,Avengers,Nick Fury,72,"(trying to explain) rogers, we gathered everything related to the tesseract. this does not mean that we're..."
263,Avengers,Nick Fury,73,because of him. (pointing at thor)
264,Avengers,Nick Fury,74,"last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. we learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned."
265,Avengers,Nick Fury,75,"but you're not the only people out there, are you? and, you're not the only threat. the world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled."
266,Avengers,Nick Fury,76,you forced our hand. we had to come up with something.
267,Avengers,Nick Fury,77,"remind me again how you made your fortune, stark?"
268,Avengers,Nick Fury,78,"excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?"
269,Avengers,Nick Fury,79,you need to step away.
270,Avengers,Nick Fury,80,"agent romanoff, would you escort dr.banner back to his..."
271,Avengers,Nick Fury,81,the cell was just in case...
272,Avengers,Nick Fury,82,hill?!
273,Avengers,Nick Fury,83,stark! you copy that?!
274,Avengers,Nick Fury,84,coulson! initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! move out!
275,Avengers,Nick Fury,85,bring the carrier inwards and head south. take us to the water.
276,Avengers,Nick Fury,86,is the sun coming up?!
277,Avengers,Nick Fury,87,then put it on the left! get us over water! one more turbine goes down and we drop.
278,Avengers,Nick Fury,88,"we need a full evac on the lower hangar bay. agent hill nods. she leaves to exit out, but a sliding grenade appears."
279,Avengers,Nick Fury,89,get his attention.
280,Avengers,Nick Fury,90,"they are not getting through here, so what the hell... suddenly, barton looses an arrow down to the bridge and explodes critical spots. barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a usb"
281,Avengers,Nick Fury,91,it's barton. he took out our systems. he's headed for the detention level. does anybody copy?
282,Avengers,Nick Fury,92,"(v.o.) stark, we're losing altitude."
283,Avengers,Nick Fury,93,just stay awake. eyes on me!
284,Avengers,Nick Fury,94,not an option.
285,Avengers,Nick Fury,95,"(v.o.) agent coulson is down. agent hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on her headset, standing up."
286,Avengers,Nick Fury,96,(v.o.) they're here.
287,Avengers,Nick Fury,97,(v.o.) they called it.
288,Avengers,Nick Fury,98,"these were in phil coulson's jacket. guess he never did get you to sign them. fury throws coulson's captain america trading cards on the table towards steve. steve picks them up, stained with blood."
289,Avengers,Nick Fury,99,"we're dead in the air up here. our communications, location of the cube, banner, thor. i got nothing for you. lost my one good eye. maybe i had that coming."
290,Avengers,Nick Fury,100,"well, it's an old fashioned notion."
291,Avengers,Nick Fury,101,agent hill?
292,Avengers,Nick Fury,102,they needed the push. (holding coulson's cards) a loud noise screeches. fury looks out to see iron man flying off as well as the quinjet.
293,Avengers,Nick Fury,103,"they found it. get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. i want eyes on everything."
294,Avengers,Nick Fury,104,"i recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision, i've elected to ignore it."
295,Avengers,Nick Fury,105,"that is the island of manhattan, councilman. until i'm certain my team can't hold it, i will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population."
296,Avengers,Nick Fury,106,"i send that bird out, we already have. fury shuts off his viewscreen."
297,Avengers,Nick Fury,107,"runs out to the deck, holding a fucking airtronic rpg- 7. he takes aim and fires, hitting the tail end of the jet. the jet skids off towards the edge. pilot unharmed. suddenly, another 7 alpha 11 jet flies off. fury stands there, knowing he can't do anything about it."
298,Avengers,Nick Fury,108,"stark, you hearing me? we have a missile headed straight for the city."
299,Avengers,Nick Fury,109,"three minutes, at best. stay low and wipe out the missile."
300,Avengers,Nick Fury,110,i'm not currently tracking their whereabouts. i'd say they've earned a leave of absence.
301,Avengers,Nick Fury,111,the tesseract is where it belongs: out of our reach.
302,Avengers,Nick Fury,112,i didn't make it. i just didn't argue with the god that did.
303,Avengers,Nick Fury,113,"oh, i think he will be."
304,Avengers,Nick Fury,114,they surely are. and the whole world knows it. every world knows it.
305,Avengers,Nick Fury,115,a promise.
306,Avengers,Nick Fury,116,they'll come back.
307,Avengers,Nick Fury,117,i am.
308,Avengers,Nick Fury,118,because we'll need them to.
969,Avengers,Tony,0,you're good on this end. the rest is up to you.
970,Avengers,Tony,1,stark tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
971,Avengers,Tony,2,"i assume. light her up. as iron man flies to the stark tower building, the power is switched on and the stark sign lights up."
972,Avengers,Tony,3,"like christmas, but with more... me."
973,Avengers,Tony,4,"pepper, you're killing me. remember? enjoy the moment."
974,Avengers,Tony,5,i'm not in. i'm actually out.
975,Avengers,Tony,6,close the line jarvis. i got a date.
976,Avengers,Tony,7,"of course they are, i was directly involved. which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?"
977,Avengers,Tony,8,what do you mean? all this came from you.
978,Avengers,Tony,9,"give yourself some credit, please. stark tower is your baby. give yourself... twelve percent of the credit."
979,Avengers,Tony,10,an argument can be made for fifteen.
980,Avengers,Tony,11,"well, i did do all the heavy lifting. literally, i lifted the heavy things. and sorry, but the security snafu? that was on you."
981,Avengers,Tony,12,my private elevator...
982,Avengers,Tony,13,"...was teeming with sweaty workmen. i'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't i? pepper pours herself and tony a glass of champagne."
983,Avengers,Tony,14,i'll tell you what. next building's gonna say 'potts' on the tower.
984,Avengers,Tony,15,"...call your mom, can you bunk over?"
985,Avengers,Tony,16,"you have reached the life model decoy of tony stark, please leave a message."
986,Avengers,Tony,17,then leave it urgently. at that moment the elevator door opens and coulson appears.
987,Avengers,Tony,18,security breach.
988,Avengers,Tony,19,"phil? uh, his first name is agent."
989,Avengers,Tony,20,which is why he can't stay.
990,Avengers,Tony,21,i don't like being handed things.
991,Avengers,Tony,22,official consulting hours are between eight and five every other thursday.
992,Avengers,Tony,23,"the avengers initiative was scrapped, i thought. and i didn't even qualify."
993,Avengers,Tony,24,"yeah, apparently i'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others."
994,Avengers,Tony,25,"whatever. miss potts, got a minute? pepper walks over to tony who places the files into his own databases."
995,Avengers,Tony,26,"you know, i thought we were having a moment."
996,Avengers,Tony,27,how did you notice? why is he phil?
997,Avengers,Tony,28,"this is, uh... tony expands his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of tony and pepper."
998,Avengers,Tony,29,"this. screens appear of captain america in action, the hulk roaring as"
999,Avengers,Tony,30,tomorrow.
1000,Avengers,Tony,31,"well, what if i didn't?"
1001,Avengers,Tony,32,yeah.
1002,Avengers,Tony,33,square deal. it's the last date. pepper kisses him.
1003,Avengers,Tony,34,what? rock of ages giving up so easily?
1004,Avengers,Tony,35,"still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. what's your thing? pilates?"
1005,Avengers,Tony,36,"it's like calisthenics. you might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a capsicle. steve looks at tony, finally meeting his ego match."
1006,Avengers,Tony,37,"yeah, there's a lot of things fury doesn't tell you. thunder and lightning nearly hit the jet, making it shake violently."
1007,Avengers,Tony,38,then don't take my stuff.
1008,Avengers,Tony,39,shakespeare in the park? doth mother know you weareth her drapes?
1009,Avengers,Tony,40,"he gives up the cube, he's all yours. until then, stay out of my way... tourist. the iron man helmet clamps up and he walks away. in one quick move, thor pulls mj�lnir, throws it, and knocks iron man clear across into a tree."
1010,Avengers,Tony,41,"okay. from the mountain side, loki watches in amusement. thor raises his hand. mj�lnir flies back to his hand. thor swings the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. iron man stands up and from his hand boosters, a blast of energy knocks the mighty avenger on his ass. iron man flies back up and knocks thor into a tree. right back at you, bitch! thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls mj�lnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in lighting and thunder! thor points the hammer at iron man and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. iron man falls back."
1011,Avengers,Tony,42,"how about that? iron man fires away from his hand boosters, pushing thor to his knees. like two gunslingers ready to draw, both thor and iron man fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up."
1012,Avengers,Tony,43,it's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with coulson; to
1013,Avengers,Tony,44,(cont'd)
1014,Avengers,Tony,45,"well, that sounds exhausting. the rest of the raw materials, agent barton can get his hands on pretty easily. only major component he still needs is a power source. a high energy density, something to kick start the cube."
1015,Avengers,Tony,46,"last night. the packet, selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers. am i the only one who did the reading?"
1016,Avengers,Tony,47,"unless, selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect."
1017,Avengers,Tony,48,"finally, someone who speaks english."
1018,Avengers,Tony,49,"it's good to meet you, dr. banner. you're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. and i'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster."
1019,Avengers,Tony,50,"shall we play, doctor?"
1020,Avengers,Tony,51,"if we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops."
1021,Avengers,Tony,52,
1022,Avengers,Tony,53,"well, i promise a stress free environment. no tension. no surprises. suddenly, tony pokes banner with a miniature electrical prod. steve walks in on them, pissed at tony."
1023,Avengers,Tony,54,nothing?
1024,Avengers,Tony,55,"you really have got a lid on it, haven't you? what's your secret? mellow jazz? bongo drums? huge bag of weed?"
1025,Avengers,Tony,56,funny things are.
1026,Avengers,Tony,57,"you're tiptoeing, big man. you need to strut."
1027,Avengers,Tony,58,you think i'm not? why did fury call us and why now? why not before? what isn't he telling us? i can't do the equation unless i have all the variables.
1028,Avengers,Tony,59,"he's a spy. captain, he's the spy. his secrets have secrets. (points to banner) it's bugging him too, isn't it?"
1029,Avengers,Tony,60,that's just the prototype. i'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
1030,Avengers,Tony,61,i should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of shield's secure files.
1031,Avengers,Tony,62,jarvis has been running it since i hit the bridge. in a few hours we'll know every dirty secret shield has ever tried to hide. (holds out a bag of blueberries) blueberry?
1032,Avengers,Tony,63,"an intelligence organization that fears intelligence? historically, not possible."
1033,Avengers,Tony,64,following is not really my style.
1034,Avengers,Tony,65,"(a nerve hit) of the people in this room, which one is; a. wearing a spangly outfit, and b. not of use?"
1035,Avengers,Tony,66,that's the guy my dad never shut up about? wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
1036,Avengers,Tony,67,what he's got is an acme dynamite kit.
1037,Avengers,Tony,68,"(cont'd) it's gonna blow up in his face, and i'm gonna be there when it does."
1038,Avengers,Tony,69,uh-huh. or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
1039,Avengers,Tony,70,"you know, i've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the mini-arc reactor in his chest) this stops it. this little circle of light. it's part of me now, not just armor. it's a... terrible privilege."
1040,Avengers,Tony,71,because i learned how.
1041,Avengers,Tony,72,"hey, i've read all about your accident. that much gamma exposure should have killed you."
1042,Avengers,Tony,73,
1043,Avengers,Tony,74,you just might.
1044,Avengers,Tony,75,uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
1045,Avengers,Tony,76,"and you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of secret files) what is phase 2? suddenly, steve drops a hydra assault rifle on the table causing fury, banner and tony to turn around. cap looks pissed."
1046,Avengers,Tony,77,"i'm sorry, nick. tony moves the computer screen towards fury which shows plans of"
1047,Avengers,Tony,78,what were you lying?
1048,Avengers,Tony,79,nuclear deterrent. `cause that always calms everything right down.
1049,Avengers,Tony,80,(puts his arm around steve) why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
1050,Avengers,Tony,81,"(comes face-to-face with cap) oh, i'm starting to want you to make me."
1051,Avengers,Tony,82,"genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."
1052,Avengers,Tony,83,i think i would just cut the wire.
1053,Avengers,Tony,84,"(that did it) a hero? like you? you're a lab rat, rogers. everything special about you came out of a bottle!"
1054,Avengers,Tony,85,got it. banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.
1055,Avengers,Tony,86,i can get there faster.
1056,Avengers,Tony,87,you gonna stop me?
1057,Avengers,Tony,88,i'm not afraid to hit an old man.
1058,Avengers,Tony,89,"yep! steve helps tony up and out of the lab. fury sits up, clutching his ribs. he puts on his earpiece."
1059,Avengers,Tony,90,(v.o.) i'm on it!
1060,Avengers,Tony,91,"find engine three. i'll meet you there. cap peels off as tony approaches a tech room. inside, tony's iron man suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory."
1061,Avengers,Tony,92,good. see what we got. tony flies in his iron man suit and gets close to the damaged engine.
1062,Avengers,Tony,93,i gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before i can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.
1063,Avengers,Tony,94,"even if i clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. i'm gonna have to get in there and push."
1064,Avengers,Tony,95,then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag...
1065,Avengers,Tony,96,"see that red lever? it'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. stand by it, wait for my word. captain america looks over at the other side where he was. he sees the red lever and jumps towards it."
1066,Avengers,Tony,97,"cap, i need the lever!"
1067,Avengers,Tony,98,"lever. now! tony lets go of the rotors. they spin by themselves. tony is then caught in one. he is now fucked. iron man slips into the rotors, getting chewed up."
1068,Avengers,Tony,99,"no. there was a uh...cellist, i think."
1069,Avengers,Tony,100,he was an idiot.
1070,Avengers,Tony,101,for taking on loki alone.
1071,Avengers,Tony,102,he was out of his league. he should have waited. he should have...
1072,Avengers,Tony,103,
1073,Avengers,Tony,104,(turns around sharply) we are not soldiers! i am not marching to fury's fife!
1074,Avengers,Tony,105,(looking at the blood stained
1075,Avengers,Tony,106,that is the point. that's loki's point. he hit us all right where we live. why?
1076,Avengers,Tony,107,"he had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? that's what he wants. he wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. he wants an audience."
1077,Avengers,Tony,108,"yeah. that's just a preview, this is opening night. loki's a full-tilt diva. he wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered..."
1078,Avengers,Tony,109,"shut it down, dr. selvig."
1079,Avengers,Tony,110,"skip the spinning rims. we're on the clock. tony lands his suit and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits him. loki looks up at him, smiling. they proceed to walk into the penthouse."
1080,Avengers,Tony,111,"uh...actually, i'm planning to threaten you."
1081,Avengers,Tony,112,"yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. you've got the blue stick of destiny. would you like a drink?"
1082,Avengers,Tony,113,"no, no, no! threatening. no drink? you sure? i'm having one."
1083,Avengers,Tony,114,
1084,Avengers,Tony,115,
1085,Avengers,Tony,116,"(cont'd) but, let's do a head count here. your brother, the demi-god; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them."
1086,Avengers,Tony,117,"not a great plan. when they come, and they will, they'll come for you. from underneath the bar table, tony pulls on colantotte bracelets, a honing device."
1087,Avengers,Tony,118,we have a hulk.
1088,Avengers,Tony,119,"you're missing the point. there's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. because if we can't protect the earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it."
1089,Avengers,Tony,120,"well, performance issues. you know? in anger, loki grabs tony by the throat and flings him across the room."
1090,Avengers,Tony,121,jarvis. anytime now. loki grabs tony by the throat again.
1091,Avengers,Tony,122,"right. army. iron man flies up towards the portal. from his shoulders, a miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and fires. like the jericho missile, several targets are taken down unlike no missile. it's useless. thousands of chitauri fly out. iron man flies towards the city."
1092,Avengers,Tony,123,fine. let's keep them occupied. iron man heads back to the portal.
1093,Avengers,Tony,124,"i'm seeing, still working on believing. where's banner? has he shown up yet?"
1094,Avengers,Tony,125,"just keep me posted. jarvis, find me a soft spot. iron man quietly flies behind and parallel with the chitauri"
1095,Avengers,Tony,126,"then tell him to suit up. i'm bringing the party to you. iron man comes out from behind a building. the chitauri leviathan follows, impatiently."
1096,Avengers,Tony,127,nice call. what else you got?
1097,Avengers,Tony,128,and he didn't invite me?
1098,Avengers,Tony,129,"i got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute. and i know just where to put it."
1099,Avengers,Tony,130,
1100,Avengers,Tony,131,what the hell? what just happened? please tell me nobody kissed me?
1101,Avengers,Tony,132,"alright. hey. alright. good job, guys. let's just not come in tomorrow. let's just take a day. have you ever tried shawarma? there's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. i don't know what it is, but i wanna try it."
1102,Avengers,Tony,133,and then shawarma after.
132,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,0,"excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? i'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost."
133,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,1,i couldn't help noticing the accent. you from jersey?
134,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,2,"austria? you're kidding. (mock-australian accent) well, g'day, mate. what do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie."
135,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,3,(cont'd) (to self) guess i won't be going down under tonight...
136,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,4,this is 22.
137,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,5,"cool your jets, arnie. i'm on my way."
138,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,6,why you going to the airport? flying somewhere?
139,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,7,"well, i saw your luggage, then when i noticed the airline ticket, i put two and two together. (beat) so where you heading?"
140,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,8,"oh, you're gonna love it. i hear california's beautiful this time of year. mary looks back out the window and lloyd sneaks another glance."
141,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,9,(cont'd) name's christmas. lloyd christmas.
142,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,10,"uh, this isn't my real job, you know. it's only temporary."
143,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,11,"yeah, you see, my friend harry and i are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store."
144,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,12,(smiling) i got worms.
145,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,13,"that's what we're gonna call it: i got worms. we're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms. a lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. they're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids."
146,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,14,"uh... well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate. and if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back."
147,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,15,"and best of all, worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year industry. i wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what i mean."
148,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,16,(cont'd) what's the matter? little tense about the flight?
149,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,17,"it's really nothing to worry about, mary. statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. you know, like in a head-on crash, or something."
150,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,18,good thinking. there's a lot of bad rivers out there.
151,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,19,keep it. it was my pleasure.
152,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,20,"(cont'd) relax, mary. just get trashed and pass out. you'll be there before you know it."
153,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,21,"(to car's driver) drive around me, you pinhead!"
154,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,22,damn!
155,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,23,"i don't mean to be harsh, harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. no offense."
156,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,24,of course not. (beat) i quit.
157,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,25,i had a hunch arnie was gonna fire me.
158,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,26,"winners control their own destiny, har."
159,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,27,big deal. that car's an old bomb anyway.
160,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,28,that's forty-two in dog years.
161,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,29,it's a love memento.
162,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,30,"the most beautiful woman alive. her name was mary. i drove her to the airport. sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved. she left this case in the terminal and flew to aspen and out of my life. end of story."
163,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,31,do you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else's private property?
164,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,32,(beat) it's locked.
165,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,33,(cont'd) (whispering to harry) friend or foe?
166,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,34,"hey, i ordered mystic mint. the little swindlers gave me peanut butter praline."
167,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,35,(cringing) that's a hostile pattern. i say we bail and get down to unemployment.
168,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,36,"blew it? for your information, we only missed three days in two months."
169,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,37,give me what's left of our dough. i'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities.
170,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,38,"(cont'd) what's cheaper, thunderbird or night train?"
171,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,39,"excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar?"
172,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,40,well could you do me a favor and guard this while i go break a dollar? my wallet's locked in this machine.
173,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,41,"it's gone. i got robbed by grandma walton. she got my wallet, too."
174,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,42,"(cont'd) come on, man, cheer up. we've been own before. i'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere. harry it gets worse, lloyd. my parakeet petey he's... he's dead."
175,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,43,"oh man, i'm sorry, harry. what happened?"
176,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,44,his head fell off?
177,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,45,(hopeful) i don't suppose he had a warranty...?
178,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,46,"that's it! i've had it with this ump! we don't have food, we don't have jobs, our pets' heads are falling off, we're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old"
179,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,47,no i won't calm down.
180,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,48,"(cont'd) what the hell are we doing here anyway, harry? we've got to get out of this town. harry yeah, and go where?"
181,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,49,"i'll tell you where: someplace warm, a place where the beer flows like wine, where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of capistrano. (dramatic pause) i'm talking about aspen."
182,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,50,"that's right, aspen."
183,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,51,"let me ask you something: do you want to end up like petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment, face- down on a dear abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? or do you want to enjoy your life? (beat) come on, harry, don't let petey's eath be in vain. don't you see what he was saying? spread your wings, man. he was saying? spread your wings, man. fly."
184,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,52,"that's bullshit. i'll drive. (beat) and what's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline? harry (torn) i don't know, lloyd. i think we should stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep saving money for the worm store. i'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors."
185,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,53,"you know what i'm sick and tired of, harry? i'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. i'm sick and tired of being a nobody. (more)"
186,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,54,"(cont'd) (beat) but most of all, i'm sick and tired of having nobody."
187,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,55,"on the other hand, maybe you're right, harry. maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court. with all those lawsuits against us, i'm sure we'll win at least one. it could be a boost to our egos."
188,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,56,"& harry ""we've got to get out of this place, if it's the last thing we ever do, we've got to get out of this place, girl, there's a better life, for me and you..."""
189,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,57,"well, we're finally doing it. do you realize that in all the years we've known each other, this is the first time we've done this together."
190,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,58,taken a trip.
191,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,59,(cont'd) why'd you do that?
192,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,60,take your seatbelt off.
193,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,61,well what about the people who live around here? what if we got into an accident with one of them?
194,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,62,bought 'em when we filled up.
195,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,63,"this didn't come out of our travel fund. i was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left. you know, so we could live in style."
196,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,64,i sold some stuff to billy in 4-c.
197,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,65,that's right.
198,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,66,just some odds and ends.
199,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,67,"oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? well who else was i gonna sell it to?"
200,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,68,"put your mind at ease, friend. i took care of it."
201,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,69,"according to this map, about an inch and a half."
202,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,70,"and i believe i'm right, harry."
203,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,71,how much you wanna bet?
204,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,72,what do you mean you don't bet?
205,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,73,"oh, bull. i'll bet you our next meal that i can get you gambling before the day's out."
206,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,74,"i'll give you three-to-one odds. that's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose."
207,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,75,"okay, five-to-one i can get you gambling before the day's out."
208,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,76,make it ten-to-one. harry sticks out his hand.
209,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,77,(to waitress)
210,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,78,(cont'd) what's the soup du jour?
211,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,79,sounds tasty. i'll have a bowl.
212,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,80,
213,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,81,uh-oh...
214,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,82,"you spilled the salt. that's bad luck. we're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck. quick, toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder."
215,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,83,because that's good luck.
216,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,84,or was it the left shoulder?
217,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,85,well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals... (brightening) wait a second. i think i just had an idea. follow me...
218,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,86,"(cont'd) excuse me, gentlemen, i'd just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier."
219,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,87,"what i'm trying to say is, my friend and i would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the hatchet."
220,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,88,"whatever you want, sir. i'll have the waitress send them over. oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road."
221,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,89,"um, sea bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check. they said just add this to their tab."
222,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,90,"well, if that guy at the table over there is sea bass..."
223,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,91,"(to cashier) by the way, how far is it to rhode island from here?"
224,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,92,i just wish we could've seen sea bass's face when he got the bill.
225,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,93,don't worry. that fish-head is probably half-way to providence by now.
226,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,94,"hey, stop the car. i gotta take a whiz."
227,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,95,but i gotta go. what am i supposed to do?
228,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,96,i can't hold it. i'm about to explode.
229,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,97,are you serious?
230,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,98,uh-oh...
231,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,99,the bottle's almost full and i'm still going.
232,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,100,"i can't stop once i already started, you know that. quick, get me another bottle."
233,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,101,"(cont'd) jesus, be careful! you almost went off the road."
234,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,102,"here, hold this."
235,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,103,"hey, i haven't gone all day."
236,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,104,"but, your honor, he's telling the truth. it's not beer."
237,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,105,"(under breath) you would, too..."
238,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,106,'s fantasy:
239,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,107,(v.o.)
240,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,108,(v.o.)
241,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,109,nothing. nothing at all.
242,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,110,"(v.o.) hey, it's the only motel that charges by the hour. we can't afford anything else."
243,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,111,"yep, this sure is the life. cold beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink sheets... you know, there's only one thing that could make this moment any better."
244,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,112,if you had a nice set of knockers.
245,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,113,right now i'd settle for one.
246,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,114,"what happened, harry? some little filly break your heart?"
247,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,115,felcher? you mean the babe who worked for the tractor company?
248,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,116,"that's cold, har. give you any reason?"
249,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,117,you're it.
250,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,118,you're it. quitsies.
251,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,119,"damn, you're good, harry. (beat) hey, didn't i tell you this trip would be a blast?"
252,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,120,"see, i told you these country folks were friendly, harry."
253,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,121,well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous aspenese air.
254,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,122,the freshest. they say on any day of the week you can smell a moose-fart ten miles away.
255,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,123,then we make a splash on the social scene.
256,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,124,"(cont'd) harry, look the golden arches. pull over, i'm starving. cut to:"
257,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,125,"look, once we drop the briefcase off to mary, she'll be so grateful she'll plug us right into the party circuit. after that, we do a little of the ski"
258,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,126,some bum down at unemployment.
259,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,127,what's the matter?
260,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,128,yeah? so?
261,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,129,"(cont'd) hey, wait a second. hold everything."
262,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,130,aren't you forgetting something?
263,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,131,(cont'd) back at mickey d's? a little matter you might've overlooked...?
264,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,132,my change.
265,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,133,it's a vegetable.
266,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,134,and i happen to know it's a vegetable.
267,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,135,fine with me.
268,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,136,"okay, harry, my turn. let 'er rip."
269,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,137,"(cont'd) hmmm... full-bodied, delicate bouquet, aged to perfection will rip no fart before it's time. (beat) come on, marquis of dingleberry's rules: you got ten seconds. all right. i'll say: cheese doodles, chili dog extra onions, garden salad with blue..."
270,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,138,kit-kat bar.
271,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,139,"okay, you go first."
272,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,140,"no, you go first."
273,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,141,"hmmm, not bad..."
274,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,142,"harry dunne, i'm surprised at you. perhaps it's about time you brushed"
275,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,143,"no, i mean like 'an eye for an eye.' hand me those peppers the atomic ones."
276,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,144,more like re-location.
277,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,145,not really. i was just her limo river.
278,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,146,"life is a fragile thing, har. one minute you're chewing on a burger; the next minute you're dead meat."
279,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,147,if you don't count that gurgling sound.
280,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,148,"(cont'd) hey, relax, man, i'm just as responsible as you are we both slipped him the peppers and look at me, i on't feel guilty at all."
281,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,149,that's ridiculous. you probably won't live to see forty.
282,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,150,"sorry, har. we're gonna have to hold out. seems we misjudged our expense allocation. if we pay for a motel we won't have enough for gas."
283,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,151,we over-leveraged.
284,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,152,the slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe and a chocolate malt.
285,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,153,drive. we've only got ten more hours. we can take turns.
286,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,154,"um, yeah could you do it the other way around?"
287,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,155,"look, harry, i told you what happened, now drop it. harry sure thing, lloyd. i promise not to mention another word about you being in a bathroom stall with a six-foot, five-inch trucker with his pants own."
288,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,156,"that's a low blow, man."
289,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,157,"listen, bud, if you're trying to imply that i'm that thought look, we're almost in colorado."
290,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,158,"hey, i picked you up a beef jerky..."
291,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,159,"(cont'd) boy, some guys just weren't cut out for life on the road."
292,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,160,"hey, mr. sleepy head, welcome back."
293,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,161,"i'd say a good five hours, anyway."
294,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,162,should be. i've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night.
295,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,163,"boy, i'll tell you, this is one angerous highway. you wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing i couldn't even recognize."
296,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,164,i hit 'em.
297,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,165,"i was thinking the same thing. that john denver's some full of shit, huh?"
298,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,166,"(cont'd) i must say, des moines sure is a pretty little town."
299,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,167,last night. we drove through it.
300,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,168,"(sing-song) hello? hello? anybody home? rise and shine. (laughs) you were the one who was asleep,"
301,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,169,"in our country it does, yes."
302,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,170,"i'm only human, harry. anybody can make a mistake."
303,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,171,"(cont'd) come on, man, pull yourself together."
304,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,172,"(rolls his eyes) you can't take a bus to europe, dodo."
305,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,173,"(cont'd) come on, stop being a baby about this. okay, so we back-tracked a tad."
306,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,174,"well it doesn't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it. if we're gonna get out of this hole, we're gonna have to dig ourselves out."
307,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,175,where you going?
308,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,176,you can't be serious.
309,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,177,"(calling out) thanks a lot, mr. perfect. like you never screwed up. harry suddenly stops in his tracks and turns back to his friend. he seems completely rained."
310,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,178,"got room for one more, if you still want to go to aspen."
311,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,179,"used car dealer. i   traded the van for it. plus i got   the guy to throw in fifty bucks for   gas money. (beat) come on, man, what   do you say? we still partners?"
312,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,180,"tell me something, harry. would you really have kept going home if i hadn't come back to get you?"
313,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,181,we were never cub scouts.
314,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,182,"relax, it's empty."
315,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,183,isn't this wonderful? what more could a couple of single guys like us ask for?
316,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,184,"you're so materialistic. (beat) why don't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to mary. who knows, maybe she'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two?"
317,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,185,um... good question.
318,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,186,"hmmmm... you know, i don't believe i caught that either."
319,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,187,"(brightening) come to think of it, there is. it's engraved right into the leather."
320,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,188,samsonite   spelled just like it sounds.
321,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,189,a little. shall we share it?
322,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,190,mmmm mmmm good...
323,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,191,hmmm... looks like an old piece of beef jerky.
324,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,192,you're pathetic. get your own.
325,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,193,roll up your window.
326,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,194,then i guess the damn anti-cold system isn't working. you really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter.
327,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,195,"right here the a/c button. i put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder."
328,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,196,(cont'd) what are you going out there for?
329,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,197,what are you worrying about now?
330,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,198,huh?
331,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,199,"(cont'd) harry, calm down! you're acting like a wild animal!"
332,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,200,"sorry, doc, i can't take medicine. i'm a christian scientist!"
333,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,201,(cont'd) what are you doing?
334,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,202,"don't do anything foolish, harry."
335,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,203,"you're making a big mistake, harry! i'll never forgive you for this!"
336,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,204,"(cont'd) harry, hold up! things are gonna get better, i promise! in fact, i think"
337,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,205,"no i'm not, man look."
338,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,206,"(choked voice) harry, look!"
339,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,207,"okay, here's the plan: we borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel."
340,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,208,and we'll keep track of the money we spend with ious.
341,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,209,"that way, whatever we borrow we can pay back."
342,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,210,"you know, as soon as we get jobs."
343,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,211,"thanks, barnard, but we'll find our own chicks."
344,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,212,"tell you what you can send up, my friend how about some chow?"
345,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,213,don't bother. just order us one of everything.
346,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,214,"oh, sorry. (beat) make that two of everything. harry smiles at this as lloyd pulls a wad of hundred dollar bills out of his pocket. he rips one off and tucks it in barnard's top pocket."
347,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,215,"(cont'd) and here you go, barney. you keep us happy, we'll keep you happy."
348,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,216,(proudly) our first iou. signed and dated.
349,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,217,"it's no dream, har. we finally cracked the big time."
350,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,218,"what's the big deal? we're gonna pay it all back anyway, right?"
351,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,219,surfboards? i thought those were beginner's skis. this suddenly makes sense to harry.
352,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,220,where'd this come from?
353,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,221,what for?
354,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,222,"harry, how many women do you know who wear a size xxl?"
355,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,223,"enter, parlez vous!"
356,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,224,"all out of boone's farm, huh? barnard you have a rapier wit, sir. i took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute: dom perignon."
357,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,225,"guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?"
358,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,226,"oh, one more thing: you can     dispense with the 'sir' crap. let's     face it, barney, we're all from the     same mold. (winks) we just have a little more     dough than you right now."
359,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,227,"(dumbstruck) harry, it's her."
360,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,228,mary with the briefcase. this is her...
361,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,229,(cont'd) mary swanson...
362,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,230,"thanks for the lift, barney."
363,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,231,this should cover a couple plates.
364,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,232,"i'm getting nervous, harry."
365,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,233,"what are you talking about? they're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated."
366,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,234,"don't do this to me, harry. i'm already a wreck. what if mary oesn't like me?"
367,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,235,"(to bartender) two martinis, straight up. as harry and lloyd silently take in the party, a beautiful red head reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away."
368,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,236,"(cont'd) shut up, harry."
369,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,237,"yeah, well i know what you were gonna say and i'm telling you to shut up in advance."
370,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,238,i read you like a book.
371,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,239,you were gonna say: (in harry's looped voice) 'that's one fiery bush i wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in.'
372,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,240,"(cont'd) and i would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like ron jeremy on spanish fly."
373,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,241,"two more, please."
374,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,242,i can't help it. this is a very important night for me. (more)
375,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,243,"(cont'd) (beat) harry, have you ever wondered why you and i never have long-term girlfriends?"
376,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,244,that was a fluke. (beat) the reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing: we're afraid of the c word.
377,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,245,i'm talking bout commitment.
378,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,246,"well i'm ready for commitment, harry. the first time i laid eyes on mary swanson, i knew she was the one. (beat) some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. this girl makes me feel it all in the heart."
379,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,247,"(cont'd) oh shit, there she is."
380,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,248,she's gonna think i'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far i came just to see her.
381,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,249,and then what? she'll take it back and that'll be it. i'm a nobody.
382,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,250,"(brightening) wait a second, i have an idea. you go over and introduce yourself. that way you can build me up so when i come along i won't have to brag about myself. tell her i'm good-looking and i'm rich and i have a rapist's wit."
383,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,251,"please harry, i'm appealing to you as one loser to another. just build me up and then give me a signal to come over. please."
384,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,252,how come you didn't call me over?
385,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,253,"wha... you... i... it's... (smiles) i love you, man. i love you!"
386,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,254,this calls for a toast!
387,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,255,"(cont'd) you're gonna be my best man, har, i mean it. it was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal."
388,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,256,mrs. christmas... mary christmas... mrs. mary christmas. you
389,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,257,"impossible. i know my type    when i see it. now let me get this    straight, she wants me to meet her at    the avalanche bar and grill on    main street?"
390,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,258,time out. where are going ressed like that.
391,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,259,you mean you're gonna go out in public dressed in tights?
392,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,260,but you can see the outline of your who-who.
393,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,261,turn sideways.
394,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,262,"(cont'd) actually, it's just a tiny little lump. no one will ever notice."
395,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,263,i'm meeting someone. mind if i wait at the bar?
396,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,264,maybe some other time.
397,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,265,"(cont'd) excuse me, you wouldn't happen to know a mary swanson, would you?"
398,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,266,do you know where she lives?
399,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,267,some best man.
400,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,268,"believe me, it was the right place. (sighs) i don't know, har, maybe she just had second thoughts."
401,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,269,what?
402,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,270,(brightening) do ya think...?
403,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,271,(shrugging) i just figured she was a raging alcoholic.
404,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,272,i knew there was an explanation. and here i thought she was standing me up.
405,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,273,will you join me in a good luck toast before you head out?
406,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,274,"pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't you?"
407,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,275,i see.
408,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,276,(cont'd) to my friend harry the matchmaker.
409,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,277,hi. (beat) don't you remember me?
410,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,278,south bend. i drove you to the airport last week.
411,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,279,you remembered.
412,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,280,i brought you your briefcase you left it at the airport so i picked it up for you.
413,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,281,"yeah, it's back at my hotel room. come on, let's take a ride. i'll give it to you."
414,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,282,"..so anyway, as soon as i got to town i tried to look you up but i idn't know your last name."
415,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,283,"'course i have it. when lloyd christmas drives a woman to the airport, he makes sure she gets all her luggage, no matter what he has to"
416,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,284,"well... no... i mean, you know, there were other reasons... (beat) actually, yeah, i guess i did."
417,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,285,"look, mary, i know this may seem a little sudden but i've given it a lot of thought: you're the woman i've been waiting for my whole life, and i'm not ashamed to admit it -- (holds up his hand) --please, let me finish. (deep breath) i'm crazy about you. i've never felt this way about anyone. you make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires. (nervous laugh) listen to me, i feel like a schoolboy again. (beat) a schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet, sweet love to you."
418,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,286,mary... (blurting out) i desperately want to make love to a schoolboy.
419,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,287,"no, that's not what imeant. i meant... i really like you, mary. i like you a lot."
420,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,288,(cont'd) i'm gonna ask you something flat out and i want you to answer me honestly: what do you think the chances are of a girl like you and a guy like me ending up together?
421,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,289,"--i asked you to be honest, mary. mary but lloyd, i really can't --"
422,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,290,"--come    on, give it to me straight. i rove a    long way to see you, the least you can    do is level with me. what are my    chances?"
423,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,291,"you mean not good, like one out of a hundred?"
424,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,292,(duh) so you're telling me there's a chance?
425,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,293,husband?
426,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,294,who are you?
427,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,295,uh-oh.
428,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,296,"uh, sir, about the briefcase, i want you to know, my friend harry and i have every intention of reimbursing you."
429,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,297,"that's as good as money, sir. those are our ious. you can add them up yourself. every penny's accounted for."
430,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,298,"now don't do anything hasty, man."
431,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,299,"(cutting) yeah, we used to be best friends."
432,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,300,me a backstabber? you got a lot of nerve. i saw her first.
433,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,301,but you knew how crazy i was about her.
434,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,302,(waning righteousness) what are you talking about?
435,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,303,"you said it, pal. maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were."
436,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,304,"i mean, if one beautiful girl   could rip us apart like this, then   it seems our friendship isn't worth a   damn. (beat) maybe we should call it quits   right here."
437,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,305,"mary's married, harry."
438,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,306,"no, i'll go first, harry. i was the one who got you into this mess."
439,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,307,"jesus christ! you killed my best friend, you bastard!"
440,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,308,harry! you're alive!
441,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,309,(dumbstruck) you gotta be kidding.
442,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,310,(to athletic beauty) but how did you...?
443,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,311,"she's something, ain't she, har? harry you were right, lloyd. she was efinitely worth the trip."
444,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,312,"guess we have to admit it, she was too good for us."
445,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,313,"look, we just wanted to say that we appreciate all you did for us during our stay."
446,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,314,"well, anyway, thanks again for everything."
447,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,315,"this joint is a little out of our budget, barney."
448,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,316,"you know what, barney, i think we'll take out chances down the road."
449,Dumb And Dumber,Lloyd,317,(v.o.) i say we head due south and try a little nose-rubbing with some of them slinky eskimo babes.
917,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,0,"okay, gang, single file. you know the rules: no pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies..."
918,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,1,"the same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell."
919,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,2,you kids stay right here...
920,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,3,"(cont'd) (at truck) hey, wait a minute!"
921,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,4,i got fired again.
922,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,5,"none taken. were you shitcanned, too?"
923,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,6,why'd you quit?
924,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,7,why didn't you wait and see if your suspicions were well-founded?
925,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,8,"you know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that i just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle. (beat) the alarm alone cost me two hundred."
926,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,9,what are you talking about? it's only six years old.
927,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,10,what's with the briefcase?
928,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,11,huh?
929,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,12,what's in it?
930,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,13,why not?
931,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,14,'s pov - a distorted-looking j.p. shay and joe mental are standing at the door.
932,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,15,(whispering) we don't have any friends.
933,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,16,"(cont'd) can't recognize them. could be student loan thugs again, or the irs, or maybe somebody pissed off about that case of girl scout cookies you bounced a check on."
934,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,17,"well, whoever they are, they look serious. one of them's even wearing plaid."
935,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,18,"yeah, and that was because of a blizzard"
936,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,19,"come on, stan. i'm sure you can find something else for us. how about another crack at that suicide hotline?"
937,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,20,get robitussin it's a better buzz.
938,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,21,where's the booze?
939,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,22,his head fell off.
940,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,23,"yeah, he was pretty old."
941,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,24,"nah, i bought him used."
942,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,25,"okay, calm down."
943,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,26,aspen?
944,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,27,"i don't know, lloyd, the french are assholes."
945,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,28,"(confused) what are you talking about, lloyd? his head fell off. (dawning realization) wait a second, i know what you're up to. you just wanna go to aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there."
946,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,29,"come on, lloyd. give us a kiss."
947,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,30,"(emotional) petey, i made a promise to you once, man... (thinking hard) ...and i'll be damned if i can remember what it was."
948,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,31,been run out of town?
949,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,32,what?
950,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,33,because we just cleared the danger zone. lloyd huh?
951,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,34,"don't you know anything, lloyd? ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. we've already traveled 6.3 miles."
952,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,35,where'd you get those?
953,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,36,"lloyd, i thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures. we're on a tight budget, remember?"
954,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,37,where'd you get twenty-five extra bucks?
955,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,38,you mean the blind kid?
956,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,39,"what did you sell him, lloyd?"
957,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,40,specifically?
958,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,41,"but lloyd, petey didn't even have a head."
959,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,42,how far have we gone?
960,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,43,shit. we're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there. we don't have enough gas money. lloyd relax. we have more than enough.
961,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,44,"i believe you're wrong, lloyd."
962,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,45,"i still say wrong, lloyd."
963,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,46,i don't bet.
964,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,47,"i mean i don't gamble, you know that. never have and never will."
965,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,48,"there's no way, lloyd. you can't do it."
966,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,49,"you're wasting your money, lloyd. i already told you, i don't gamble."
967,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,50,"sorry, pal, no way."
968,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,51,"you got yourself a bet, sucker!"
969,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,52,"actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well. could you please bring me a spoon?"
970,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,53,what's the matter?
971,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,54,what for?
972,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,55,"it was a terrible accident, sir. believe me, i would never do anything to offend a man of your size. please accept my most sincere apology."
973,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,56,um... the thought had crossed my mind.
974,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,57,"nah, you go ahead."
975,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,58,perfect. i'm out eight bucks and i still haven't eaten.
976,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,59,"lloyd, what are you doing? you know we can't afford to buy them drinks."
977,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,60,"oh, and put these on there, too."
978,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,61,i hope we never have to.
979,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,62,i hope so.
980,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,63,are you crazy? i'm not stopping now. what if they figure out we went the other way. they'll be on us in no time.
981,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,64,hold it.
982,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,65,well... just take a whiz in an empty beer bottle. there's a couple on the floor in the back seat.
983,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,66,"yes, i'm serious. i'm not stopping now. we could get killed. lloyd sighs. he takes an empty beer bottle from the back seat and unzips his fly. suddenly we hear a peeing sound. then:"
984,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,67,what's the matter?
985,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,68,well stop going.
986,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,69,"i'm sorry, lloyd. i'm doing the best i can."
987,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,70,"what are you, a goddamn camel?"
988,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,71,huh?
989,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,72,"(calling out) no, it's a cardigan! but thanks for noticing!"
990,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,73,"(cont'd) jesus, what is this, the fashion police?"
991,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,74,"yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty in the car."
992,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,75,"no, sir."
993,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,76,"oh, that's nothing, sir."
994,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,77,"sir, i wouldn't trooper --you'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you."
995,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,78,"(v.o.) i don't know, lloyd, i feel a little sleazy staying here when we're not even engaged."
996,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,79,what's that?
997,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,80,"that's two things, lloyd."
998,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,81,"i don't know, lloyd, these places just don't do it for me. brings back too many memories."
999,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,82,"nah, it was a girl. fraida felcher. we stayed at a place like this once no-tell motel out on route 31."
1000,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,83,"the same. we had this incredibly romantic time. boy, i thought we'd be together forever. (sighs) then about a week later, right out of the blue, she sends me a john deere letter."
1001,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,84,i called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that. i wasn't really paying attention.
1002,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,85,(cont'd) thing that really hurts is i think she was seeing another guy. never id find out who.
1003,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,86,you're it.
1004,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,87,(tapping him back) anti-quitsies. you're it. quitsies. no anti-quitsies. no startsies.
1005,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,88,"refresh my memory on something, lloyd: what exactly do we do when we get to aspen?"
1006,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,89,"fresh, huh?"
1007,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,90,"(sincere) wow... talk about paradise. (beat) and after we're finished breathing, what next, lloyd?"
1008,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,91,thanks.
1009,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,92,about this social scene how do you expect a couple mutts like us to make a splash in the land of pedigrees when we don't even have any money?
1010,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,93,"i don't know, lloyd."
1011,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,94,"money does terrible things to people. i mean, we could lose our friendship."
1012,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,95,what?
1013,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,96,what?
1014,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,97,i think this guy's in trouble. why on't you pull over.
1015,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,98,it's a fruit.
1016,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,99,"i'm telling you, it's a fruit."
1017,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,100,"tell you what, why don't we leet an impartial judge decide."
1018,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,101,"hey, mr. mentalino, settle our bet: are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?"
1019,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,102,and...?
1020,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,103,"you're the best, man. (beat) okay, my turn. lloyd where are your manners, harry? we have a guest."
1021,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,104,"come on, mr. mentalino. let one fly. it's only a buck."
1022,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,105,i'll do one if you will.
1023,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,106,"no, you go first."
1024,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,107,"yeah, more tingly than hot."
1025,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,108,"that really wasn't very polite of him, was it? maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair."
1026,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,109,(humbled) you mean like 'turn the other cheek?'
1027,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,110,(whispering) here he comes.
1028,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,111,the briefcase isn't even ours. some lady just left it at the airport. we're bringing it back to her.
1029,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,112,"hey, you okay, man? it was just a goof."
1030,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,113,i can't believe it...
1031,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,114,but he blamed me. you heard him. those were his last words.
1032,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,115,"small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids. (sighs) don't you get it, lloyd. i've got a ead guy pissed at me. his restless spirit will probably haunt me for the next seventy-five years."
1033,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,116,let's get off and crash at a motel before i crash into one. (yawning) i need a crib fast.
1034,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,117,what happened to the dough?
1035,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,118,on what? lloyd i sprung for mr. chili pepper's last meal. felt it was the least we could o after we deep-sixed him.

1043,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,126,(impressed) cool.
1044,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,127,(re: suitcases in back seat) that's a lot of luggage for a little vacation.
1045,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,128,"(holding out mirror) here, this is a little loose."
1046,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,129,(cont'd) allow me...
1047,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,130,"(cont'd) look, um, maybe when i get to aspen we can meet up... you know, for hot chocolate or something."
1048,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,131,"(urgently) look, why don't you just tell it to me, i've got a good memory."
1049,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,132,(desperate) positive please hurry.
1050,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,133,"you've got some serious explaining to o, young man."
1051,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,134,not at that height it's not.
1052,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,135,i think it's about   time we pull over and change seats.   i've been driving for nine straight   hours i  don't have the energy to   start a new state.
1053,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,136,(groggy) how long have i been out?
1054,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,137,"great. we must be getting real close, huh?"
1055,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,138,good man.
1056,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,139,that's awful. did you see them get hit or were they already lying there?
1057,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,140,funny. i expected the rocky mountains to be a little rockier than this.
1058,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,141,"yeah, it really is. (beat) wait a minute when did you visit des moines?"
1059,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,142,what are you talking about? you were snoring like a baby when we went through des moines.
1060,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,143,"uh, lloyd, refresh my memory: doesn't the sun rise in the east and set in the west?"
1061,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,144,then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at 7:30 in the morning when we're heading west.
1062,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,145,"you know, i got half a mind to just jump on the bus to europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever."
1063,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,146,oh yeah? why not? lloyd you don't have a passport.
1064,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,147,"a tad? lloyd, you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction. now we don't have enough money to get to aspen, we on't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough to eat, we don't have enough to sleep!"
1065,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,148,"you know, you're absolutely right, lloyd."
1066,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,149,home. i'm walking home.
1067,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,150,(sarcastic) why not? we're probably only five miles away.
1068,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,151,"look, man... i'm sorry. (beat) i never should have let you talk me into this in the first place. you've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl's waiting for you. but let's face it, lloyd, there's nothing waiting for me in aspen. (beat) there's nothing waiting for me anywhere."
1069,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,152,where'd you find this baby?
1070,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,153,"well let me put it this way, lloyd: do you remember when we were cub scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? we huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. do you remember that?"
1071,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,154,exactly.
1072,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,155,(cont'd) what the hell is this? there's a coffin in the back!
1073,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,156,i don't give a shit. i'm not driving anywhere with a casket. you know i'm superstitious calm down. we'll dump it off first chance we get.
1074,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,157,how about food and shelter?
1075,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,158,"jolly good idea, chap. and where oes the lovely young lady reside?"
1076,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,159,well what's her last name? we'll look it up in the phone book.
1077,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,160,what is it?
1078,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,161,any soup left?
1079,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,162,please.
1080,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,163,"hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth. lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it."
1081,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,164,wanna split it?
1082,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,165,"i'm freezing my ass off, lloyd."
1083,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,166,it is rolled up.
1084,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,167,what anti-cold system?
1085,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,168,to warm up.
1086,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,169,i'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling i'm about to give you.
1087,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,170,"get over here and take your medicine, lloyd!"
1088,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,171,something i should've done a long time ago. this stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along.
1089,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,172,foolish? this is the most sensible thing i've done in years. i'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river. lloyd starts to follow after harry.
1090,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,173,you're bluffing.
1091,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,174,"that's a filling, you liar!"
1092,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,175,"(cont'd) i used to have a life! a miserable one, but a life, nonetheless!"
1093,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,176,sounds good.
1094,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,177,we'll be meticulous    right down to the last penny.
1095,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,178,absolutely. we're good for it.
1096,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,179,it'll come right out of our first paycheck.
1097,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,180,oh. then go ahead and send thim up. what are their names?
1098,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,181,one of everything? lloyd...
1099,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,182,"oh god, it's really true. last night i thought i might've been dreaming."
1100,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,183,and it was so simple. all it took was somebody else's money.
1101,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,184,"(cont'd) you know, lloyd, i think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today."
1102,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,185,"sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards?"
1103,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,186,ahhh. i was wondering why you had those bindings put on them.
1104,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,187,(sheepishly) i bought it.
1105,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,188,"i like the feel of it against my skin... (defensive) ...i mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it."
1106,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,189,"look, leave me alone. i'm rich now. i'm supposed to have a few eccentricities."
1107,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,190,cocktail hour has commenced!
1108,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,191,"(cont'd) hey, later on what do you say we...?"
1109,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,192,(cont'd) lloyd... you okay?
1110,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,193,who?
1111,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,194,"come on, cinderella, it's time to get you ready for the ball..."
1112,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,195,"i'm kind of hungry, lloyd. what if we want seconds?"
1113,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,196,"relax, lloyd. these people are just like you and me."
1114,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,197,"so what? we can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound."
1115,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,198,"look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. a little booze'll bring back that old lloyd christmas over-confidence."
1116,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,199,i didn't say anything.
1117,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,200,how do you know what i was gonna say?
1118,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,201,"okay, if you read me like a book then what was i gonna say?"
1119,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,202,"lloyd, i've never seen you this uptight. you've gotta chill out."
1120,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,203,what are you talking about? i went out with fraida felcher for two and a half weeks.
1121,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,204,that's crazy. we live for the c word.
1122,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,205,(beat) oh.
1123,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,206,"(checking her out) wow. you weren't kidding, lloyd. she's an angel. (beat) well, what are you waiting for? get over there and talk to her."
1124,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,207,you have her briefcase she's gonna be thrilled to see you.
1125,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,208,"look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl. don't quit on the last fifty feet."
1126,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,209,"i can't tell her you're good looking, lloyd she's got eyes."
1127,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,210,all right. but you're gonna owe me a big one for this.
1128,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,211,(cont'd) nice set of hooters you got there.
1129,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,212,the owls. they're beautiful.
1130,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,213,"well, i used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines that's dogs to the layperson."
1131,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,214,"oh, i've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; i've even bred them."
1132,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,215,"nah, mostly just doggie-style. but one time we successfully mated a bulldog and a shitzu."
1133,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,216,yeah. we called it a bullshit. (breaks out laughing) just a little breeder joke.
1134,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,217,"(cont'd) anyway, the real reason i came over is because i want to introduce you to a friend of mine."
1135,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,218,harry dunne. pleasure meeting you both.
1136,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,219,(taken aback) you were?
1137,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,220,really?
1138,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,221,"(cont'd) anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, mr. dunne? because i believe mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. whuh?"
1139,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,222,"oh, i don't know. you see, my friend your friends for one day. you and mary will have a ball."
1140,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,223,"(cont'd) um... well... i don't know. you see, the thing is... sure."
1141,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,224,"relax, you're golden. i got you a ate with her tomorrow."
1142,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,225,"okay, get a grip, lloyd. you're making a scene."
1143,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,226,"(under breath) i think we've done enough hobnobbing, lloyd."
1144,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,227,"sounds nice, lloyd, but don't you think you may be jumping the gun a little? i mean, who knows, when you get to know her, you may find out she's not your type."
1145,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,228,that's what she said. ten o'clock sharp.
1146,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,229,"i, uh, thought while you were making your love connection i'd try my luck on the slopes."
1147,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,230,these aren't tights. they're fashionable euro-trash ski trousers.
1148,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,231,really?
1149,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,232,you're right. i can't go out dressed like this.
1150,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,233,sorry i'm late. it's a bitch driving a clutch with these things.
1151,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,234,(calling out) you take the first run alone. i'm gonna loosen up down here.
1152,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,235,glorious.
1153,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,236,why not?
1154,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,237,thanks.
1155,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,238,"(cont'd) oh, look... frost."
1156,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,239,(lisping) sure. i do this all the time... cut to:
1157,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,240,(lisping) see ya at the bottom...
1158,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,241,"(lisping) hi. (off their looks) say, kids, you wouldn't happen to have a cup of warm water, would you?"
1159,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,242,"(lisping) i'm fine, i'm fine. it'll come off."
1160,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,243,"my pleasure, mary."
1161,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,244,better make it quarter to eight. i've got a few things to take care of first.
1162,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,245,(cont'd) (to himself) mary dunne... mrs. mary dunne... got a nice ring to it.
1163,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,246,"i have a hard time believing that, lloyd. the girl said she couldn't wait to see you again."
1164,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,247,(cont'd) wait a minute...
1165,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,248,it just occurred to me. she must've meant ten o'clock at night.
1166,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,249,of course! why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the morning?
1167,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,250,"boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?"
1168,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,251,"that'll teach you to jump to conclusions. (beat) anyway, since you have your night all"
1169,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,252,"(o.s.) sure thing, pal. whatever you think will help your chances."
1170,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,253,uh... it's for mature audiences. i on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door.
1171,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,254,huh?
1172,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,255,"um, no, i was just... shaving."
1173,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,256,(o.s.) yeah! i was running a little late. thought this would save time.
1174,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,257,"(under breath) come on, flush, you bastard..."
1175,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,258,"uh... just cleaning my teeth. give me a minute, mary, i'll be right with you."
1176,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,259,but mary --
1177,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,260,"(mumbling to himself) it's all kharma, harry. you screw your best friend over and it's gonna come back to haunt you, plain and simple..."
1178,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,261,you...? what are you doing here?
1179,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,262,"lloyd, are you home? we've gotta talk, man. i have a serious confession to make."
1180,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,263,"(cont'd) oh good, you found her. i'll just leave you two kids alone."
1181,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,264,until he turned into a backstabber.
1182,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,265,"hey, i couldn't help it if she found me irresistable."
1183,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,266,"yeah, and you knew how crazy i was about fraida felcher, but that didn't stop you, did it?"
1184,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,267,"don't deny it, lloyd. fraida told me the whole sordid story."
1185,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,268,"well i guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we?"
1186,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,269,guess not.
1187,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,270,"just tell me where to sign, bud."
1188,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,271,i wouldn't pull that trigger if i were you.
1189,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,272,(smug) except you're forgetting one minor etail.
1190,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,273,"if you kill us, you'd be killing yourself."
1191,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,274,"you see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. in other words, i am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened"
1192,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,275,husband? what husband?
1193,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,276,kill her. the bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. it would've saved us a lot of trouble.
1194,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,277,"no, wait, do me first. i'm the one who stole your girl, lloyd. i eserve it."
1195,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,278,she grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up. they slapped this on me and gave me a gun.
1196,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,279,"yeah, about that dough..."
1197,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,280,"hey, barney..."
1198,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,281,"and we're, um, sorry about the money we gave you turning out to be phony. bell captain don't worry about it, gentlemen. the swanson family has promised to reimburse everyone."
1199,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,282,i dunno. i'm sure we'll find a trailer camp somewhere to call home.
1200,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,283,are you on the level?
1201,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,284,"(v.o.) since we're finished elbow-rubbing, what next, lloyd?"
1202,Dumb And Dumber,Harry,285,(v.o.) now you're talking my language. you know i got a weakness for blondes.
942,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,0,"haven't you had any sleep, mr frodo?"
943,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,1,(cont'd) i've gone and had too much!
944,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,2,"looks at the dead, brown twilight, below the lowering cloud."
945,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,3,(cont'd) it must be getting late.
946,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,4,not before mr frodo's had something to eat.
947,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,5,shoots gollum a hostile look and turns back to rummage in his knapsack. he holds up a piece of dried lembas bread to frodo.
948,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,6,here.
949,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,7,"(lying badly) i'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas bread."
950,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,8,(confessing) alright. we don't have that much left. (more)
951,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,9,the journey home.
952,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,10,"(yelling)            ,�     . you treacherous little toad!"
953,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,11,drops the pot and flings himself on top of gollum! gollum screams . . . his arms and legs flailing wildly!
954,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,12,(fuming) i heard it from his own mouth        he means to murder us!
955,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,13,makes for smeagol again . . . with a look of murderous rage.
956,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,14,you miserable little maggot! i'll stove your head in!
957,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,15,call me a liar! you're a liar!
958,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,16,pulls away from frodo . . .
959,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,17,"i don't care! i can't do it, mr frodo. i won' t wait around for him to kill us !"
960,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,18,stares at frodo . . . at a loss.
961,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,19,"you don't see it, do you? he's a villain!"
962,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,20,"(taken aback) i'm on your side, mr frodo."
963,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,21,"no, mr frodo!"
964,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,22,"runs after frodo, catching him in his arms as he stumbles,"
965,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,23,no!
966,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,24,and gollum pull frodo from the bridge.
967,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,25,and gollum lead frodo to the stairs ...
968,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,26,(alarmed yell) mr frodo!
969,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,27,"(cont'd) get back, you. don't touch him!"
970,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,28,"watches a sleeping gollum suspiciously as he desperately tries to stay awake. slowly, inevitably, sam, falls asleep."
971,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,29,"breathes deeply now, heavily asleep."
972,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,30,"what are you up to? sneaking off, are we?"
973,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,31,"alright, alright - you just startled me is all. (peering over the cliff's edge) what were you doing?"
974,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,32,"fine, have it your own way."
975,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,33,gently shakes frodo's shoulder.                            -
976,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,34,"(cont'd) sorry to wake you, mr frodo. we have to be moving on."
977,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,35,"rummages through his knapsack, looking for a bite to eat. frodo sits up slowly."
978,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,36,it's always dark here -
979,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,37,(cont'd) it's gone . . . the elven bread!
980,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,38,slowly turns to gollum ...
981,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,39,(dawning realisation) he took it! he must have!
982,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,40,you're a lying wretch! what did you do with it?
983,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,41,(angry) that's a filthy lie!
984,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,42,is enraged . . . he throws himself at gollum .. punching him!
985,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,43,(cont'd) (yelling) you stinking two-faced sneak! call me a thie . . . f
986,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,44,(yelling) i'll kill him! i'll kill him!
987,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,45,"alight, i'm sorry, i didn't mean for it to go so far, i was so angry . . . here, let's rest up a bit."
988,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,46,attempts to fuss around frodo ...
989,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,47,"no, no, you're not alright! you're exhausted! it's that gollum; it's this place; it's that thing around your neck. i could help a bit . . . i could carry it for a while - share the load."
990,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,48,(confused) i don't want to keep it . . . i just want to help!
991,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,49,"(beside himself) shut up, you! go away. get out of here."
992,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,50,stares at frodo with disbelief. /
993,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,51,(hopelessly) but . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you against me.
994,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,52,you don't mean that.
995,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,53,"stumbles blindly down the ancient stairs, reckless and uncaring, his face pale and devastated."
996,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,54,"let him go, you filth!"
997,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,55,(cont'd) you will not touch him again!
998,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,56,"moves forward, a fell light in his normally friendly eyes"
999,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,57,(cont'd) come on and finish it!
1000,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,58,ducks inside the arch of her legs and stabs sting into one of her eye clusters!
1001,Lord Of Rings Return,Sam,59,(cont'd) (worried) mr frodo!                        .

1290,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,39,steering shadowfax up the steep streets of minas tirith. (continued)
1291,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,40,"and pippin dismount, leaving the guards of the citadel to tend to shadowfax. gandalf hurries off . . ."
1292,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,41,"yes, the white tree of gondor. the tree of the king."
1293,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,42,"leads pippin across a flat court of white stones, surrounded by green lawns . . . towards a great hall benejath the gleaming tower.                                         ' \"
1294,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,43,"(cont'd) lord denethor, however, is not the king. he is a steward only. a caretaker of the throne."
1295,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,44,"lowers his voice, as they approach the tower hall."
1296,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,45,"strides down the hall, with pippin following obediently behind."
1297,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,46,"hail, denethor, son of ecthelion, lord and steward of gondor."
1298,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,47,(cont'd) i come with tidings in this dark hour - and with counsel.
1299,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,48,(hurried whisper) pippin!
1300,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,49,"(to pippin) get up! (a ddre ssin g d enet hor) my lord, there will be a time to grieve for boromir, but it is not now. war is coming ... the enemy is on your doorstep. as steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. where are condor's armies?"
1301,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,50,(cont'd) you still have friends - you are not alone in this fight. send word to theoden of rohan. light the beacons.
1302,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,51,(stung) authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king - steward!
1303,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,52,come.
1304,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,53,and pippin stride from the tower hall ... denethor slumps back into his seat.
1305,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,54,"you're in the service of the steward now - you're going to have to do as you're told, peregrin took . . . (under his breath) guard of the citadel!"
1306,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,55,watches the young hobbit.
1307,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,56,it's the deep breath before the plunge.
1308,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,57,"joins pippin as they look towards the distant, jagged mountains of mordor . . ."
1309,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,58,there never was much hope.
1310,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,59,(cont'd) just a fool's hope.
1311,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,60,and pippin share a quiet moment as they stare out towards the fiery sky over mordor . . .
1312,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,61,this will be the end of gondor as we know it. here the hammerstroke will fall hardest.
1313,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,62,"looks down at pippin, he says nothing ..."
1314,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,63,stares into the distance as if seeing something in his mind's eye.
1315,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,64,"the witchking of angmar . . . (he looks down at a startled pippin)         ,           . ; you've met him before . . ."
1316,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,65,(cont'd) he stabbed frodo on weathertop.
1317,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,66,(quiet) we come to it at last ... the great battle of our time.
1318,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,67,"(to himself) the board is set, the pieces are moving."
1319,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,68,"peregrin took, my lad, there is a task to be done. another opportunity for one of the shire-folk to prove their great worth!"
1320,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,69,"kneels down and looks at pippin earnestly, his hand on pippin's shoulder."
1321,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,70,(cont'd) you must not fail me.
1322,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,71,watches as pippin hurries away.
1323,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,72,(to himself) amon din ... come on . . .
1324,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,73,(to himself) hope is kindled.
1325,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,74,"thunders into view, raising his staff ..."
1326,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,75,foreseen and done nothing!
1327,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,76,where? when?
1328,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,77,(shocked realisation) . . . and then the pass of cirith ungol.
1329,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,78,(urgent) faramir . . . tell me everything.
1330,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,79,faramir! your father's will has turned to madness! do not throw away your life so rashly!
1331,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,80,"reads the pain in faramir's eyes . . . he calls after him, trying one more time to stop the young man."
1332,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,81,"your father loves you, faramir! (quietly) and will remember it before the end."
1333,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,82,"sits quietly in a courtyard, alone, defeated."
1334,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,83,"'s staff smashes into the back of denethor's head! gandalf grimly swings his staff again, clubbing denethor to the ground!"
1335,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,84,(yell) prepare for battle!!
1336,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,85,(yelling) return to your posts!
1337,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,86,(angry yell) send these foul beasts into the abyss!
1338,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,87,walks the battlements as the huge boulders rain onto the orc army below ...
1339,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,88,(rallying) stand to your posts! do not give in to fear. fight!
1340,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,89,(cont'd) not at the towers! aim for the trolls! kill the trolls! bring them down!
1341,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,90,(cont'd) peregrin took - go .back to the citadel!
1342,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,91,(urgency) this is no place for a hobbit!
1343,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,92,"welds his staff, cutting through the attacking orc with ease ... behind him, an orc prepares to cut down gandalf ... pippin instinctively slashes his sword at him."
1344,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,93,"(cont'd) guard of the citadel, indeed! now, back up the hill - quickly! quickly!"
1345,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,94,to the gates! man the gates!
1346,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,95,rallies the line of bowmen as they wait in front of the great doors ... their courage wavering with each crashing b ow . . . l                          .
1347,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,96,(commanding) steady! steady!
1348,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,97,(cont'd) you are soldiers of gondor! no matter what comes through that gate you will stand your ground!
1349,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,98,(cont'd) (yelling) fire!
1350,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,99,pull back - to the second level! hurry! get the women and children out of here - get them out! (continued)
1351,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,100,fight! fight for your lives!
1352,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,101,wheels around on shadowfax . . . (continued)
1353,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,102,pulls pippin onto shadowfax.
1354,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,103,come! quickly!
1355,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,104,(yelling) stay this madness!
1356,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,105,looks at the small hobbit a beat.
1357,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,106,"(gently) end? no, the journey doesn't end here."
1358,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,107,"(cont'd) death is just another path, one that we all must take."
1359,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,108,(cont'd) (remembering) the grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silver glass . . . (to himself) and then you see it . . .
1360,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,109,white shores ... and beyond . . . a far green country under a swift sunrise.
1361,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,110,"(gently) no . . . no, it isn't."
1362,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,111,frodo has passed beyond my sight. the darkness is deepening.
1363,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,112,"it's only a matter of time. he has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of mordor our enemy is regrouping."
1364,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,113,looks across at the dwarf . . . his face ashen.
1365,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,114,because ten thousand ores now stand between frodo and mount doom. (more) (continued)
1366,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,115,looks up sharply at aragorn . . .
1367,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,116,how?
1368,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,117,(doubtful) sauron will suspect a trap. he will not take the bait!
1369,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,118,", legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin ride directly behind him."
1370,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,119,'s face breaks into a smile ... then laughter ...
1371,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,120,places the crown upon aragorn's head.
1372,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,121,now come the days of the king ...
1373,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,122,(cont'd)                      : (softly to aragorn) may they be blessed.
1374,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,123,"kneels before sam, merry and pippin - who are all looking tearful."
1375,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,124,"farewell, my brave hobbits. my work is now finished. here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our fellowship."
1376,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,125,"(cont'd) i will not say: ""do not weep"", for not all tears are an evil."
1377,Lord Of Rings Return,Gandalf,126,"(cont'd) it is time, frodo."
404,American-Psycho,Bateman,0,"(v.o.) we're sitting in pastels, this nouvelle northern california  place on the upper east side."
405,American-Psycho,Bateman,1,"(v.o.)  you'll notice that my friends and i all look and behave in  a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences  between us. mcdermott is the biggest asshole. van  patten is the yes man. price is the most wired. i'm the  best looking. we all have light tans. right now i'm in a  bad mood because this is not a good table, and van patten  keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress ."
406,American-Psycho,Bateman,2,or can it be worn with a suit?
407,American-Psycho,Bateman,3,with discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or  charcoal gray vest. a plaid suit would cal i for a bolder  vest.
408,American-Psycho,Bateman,4,van patten looks puffy. has he stopped working out?
409,American-Psycho,Bateman,5,that's not paul owen. paul owen's on the other side of the room. over there.
410,American-Psycho,Bateman,6,"oh jesus, mcdermott, what does that have to do with  anything?"
411,American-Psycho,Bateman,7,"you spin a dreidel, mcdermott, not a menorah.  you spin a dreidel."
412,American-Psycho,Bateman,8,no. just cool it with the anti-semitic remarks.
413,American-Psycho,Bateman,9,"whoa, wait. may i ask where pamela is during all  this?"
414,American-Psycho,Bateman,10,"i'm not sure, guy, but i don't think dyslexia is a  virus."
415,American-Psycho,Bateman,11,maybe it's just the light.
416,American-Psycho,Bateman,12,what?
417,American-Psycho,Bateman,13,it's definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do  enough of it we'll be okay.
418,American-Psycho,Bateman,14,calm down. let's do it anyway
419,American-Psycho,Bateman,15,that's the spirit.
420,American-Psycho,Bateman,16,(to bargirl) two stoli on the rocks.
421,American-Psycho,Bateman,17,"(v.0.)  my name is patrick bateman. i am  twenty-six years old. i live in the american garden  buildings on west eighty-first street, on the eleventh  floor tom cruise lives in the penthouse."
422,American-Psycho,Bateman,18,"(v.0.) i believe in taking care of myself, in a  balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. in the  morning, if my face is a little puffy, i'll put on an ice  pack while doing my stomach crunches. i can do a thousand  now."
423,American-Psycho,Bateman,19,"(v.o.)  after i remove the icepack, i use a deep  pore-cleanser lotion. in the shower, i use a  water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body  scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub."
424,American-Psycho,Bateman,20,(v.o.)  then i apply an herb mint facial masque which  i leave on for ten minutes while i prepare the rest of my  routine.
425,American-Psycho,Bateman,21,"(v.o.) i always use an after-shave lotion with little  or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes  you look older. then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye  balm, followed by a final moisturizing ""protective"" lotion..."
426,American-Psycho,Bateman,22,"(v.o.)  there is an idea of a patrick bateman, some  kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an  entity, something illusory, and though i can hide my cold  gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you  and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably  comparable: i simply am not there."
427,American-Psycho,Bateman,23,"(v.o.)  it is hard for me to make sense on any given  level. my self is fabricated, an aberration. my personality  is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is  persistent."
428,American-Psycho,Bateman,24,"(v.0.)  my conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared  a long time ago, if they ever did exist."
429,American-Psycho,Bateman,25,aerobics class. sorry. any messages?
430,American-Psycho,Bateman,26,i occasionally box with ricky at the harvard club.  anyone else?
431,American-Psycho,Bateman,27,when?
432,American-Psycho,Bateman,28,negative. cancel it.
433,American-Psycho,Bateman,29,just...say...no.
434,American-Psycho,Bateman,30,"okay, jean. i need reservations for three at camols  at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try crayons. all  right?"
435,American-Psycho,Bateman,31,oh wait. and i need reservations for two at arcadia at eight  tonight.
436,American-Psycho,Bateman,32,"no, silly. forget it. i'll make them. thanks."
437,American-Psycho,Bateman,33,"no. no. be a doll and just get me a perrier, okay?"
438,American-Psycho,Bateman,34,is that the ransom file? thanks. don't wear that  outfit again.
439,American-Psycho,Bateman,35,"i said ""do not wear that outfit again."" wear a  dress. a skirt or something."
440,American-Psycho,Bateman,36,"come on, you're prettier than that."
441,American-Psycho,Bateman,37,i'm not here. and high heels. i like high heels.
442,American-Psycho,Bateman,38,(v.o.)  i'm trying to listen to the new george  michael tape but evelyn-my supposed fianc�e-keeps buzzing  in my ear.
443,American-Psycho,Bateman,39,(removing his walkman)  do...what.
444,American-Psycho,Bateman,40,evelyn?
445,American-Psycho,Bateman,41,is your evian spiked?
446,American-Psycho,Bateman,42,no-i can't take the time off work.
447,American-Psycho,Bateman,43,i don't want to talk about it.
448,American-Psycho,Bateman,44,because i...want...to...fit...in.
449,American-Psycho,Bateman,45,"(v.o.)  i'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at espace  since i'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do,  and relief washes over me in an awesome wave."
450,American-Psycho,Bateman,46,(after smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and  checking his hair)  hi. pat bateman.
451,American-Psycho,Bateman,47,let me guess-you live in the east village?
452,American-Psycho,Bateman,48,"(v.o.) i am fairly sure that timothy and evelyn  are having an affair. timothy is the only interesting person i know. courtney is almost perfect looking. she s  usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. tonight  i believe it's xanax. more disturbing than her drug use,  though, is the fact that she's engaged to luis carruthers,  the biggest dufus in the business."
453,American-Psycho,Bateman,49,"oh come on. price. there are a lot more important  problems than sri lanka to worry about. sure our foreign  policy is important, but there are more pressing problems  at hand."
454,American-Psycho,Bateman,50,"well, we have to end apartheid for one. and slow  down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world  hunger. but we can't ignore our social needs. either we  have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. we  have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and  oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while  also promoting equal rights for women but change the  abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still  somehow maintain women's freedom of choice."
455,American-Psycho,Bateman,51,"we also have to control the influx of illegal  immigrants. we have to encourage a return to traditional  moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on tv, in  movies, in pop music, everywhere. most importantly we have  to promote general social concern and less materialism in  young people."
456,American-Psycho,Bateman,52,why don t you just go for price?
457,American-Psycho,Bateman,53,he's rich.
458,American-Psycho,Bateman,54,he's good-looking.
459,American-Psycho,Bateman,55,he has a great body
460,American-Psycho,Bateman,56,no. i'm not. why should i ?
461,American-Psycho,Bateman,57,it's not.
462,American-Psycho,Bateman,58,hello.
463,American-Psycho,Bateman,59,"listen, wait. you're not...shhh wait... you're not giving me valid reasons."
464,American-Psycho,Bateman,60,what are you trying to say to me?
465,American-Psycho,Bateman,61,bleach-ee? are you trying to say bleach-ee?  bleach-ee. oh my god.
466,American-Psycho,Bateman,62,(talking over her)  two things. one. you can't bleach a soprani. out of the question.  two. (louder)  two. i can only get these sheets in santa fe. these are very  expensive sheets and i really need them clean.
467,American-Psycho,Bateman,63,"if you don't shut your fucking mouth i will kill  you, are you understanding me?"
468,American-Psycho,Bateman,64,"now listen-i have a very important lunch meeting  (checks rolex)  at hubert's in thirty minutes, and i need those  ...no wait, twenty minutes. i have a lunch meeting at  hubert's in twenty minutes with ronald harrison and i need  those sheets cleaned by this afternoon."
469,American-Psycho,Bateman,65,this is crazy. you're a fool. i can't cope with  this.
470,American-Psycho,Bateman,66,stupid bitchee! understand? oh christ!
471,American-Psycho,Bateman,67,hello  (mumbles un incomprehensible name)

474,American-Psycho,Bateman,70,"well, i mean, um, it s really...bosco. you  know, like... like a dove bar. it's a dove bar...hershey's syrup?"
475,American-Psycho,Bateman,71,"listen, if you could talk to them  (he yanks the sheet out of the man's hand)  i would really appreciate it. i'm really late. i have a  lunch appointment at hubert's in fifteen minutes."
476,American-Psycho,Bateman,72,"yeah, well, oh boy, listen, i've got to go. thank  you, uh... victoria?"
477,American-Psycho,Bateman,73,"oh, i don't know, victoria. i'm at work all the  time."
478,American-Psycho,Bateman,74,(checking his watch)  next saturday?
479,American-Psycho,Bateman,75,"oh, can't, i'm afraid. matin�e of les miserables.  listen, i've really got to go. i'll-oh...christ...i'll call  you."
480,American-Psycho,Bateman,76,"listen, what are you doing tonight?"

487,American-Psycho,Bateman,83,pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in new  york.
488,American-Psycho,Bateman,84,"pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling  dickweed."
489,American-Psycho,Bateman,85,courtney? dinner?
490,American-Psycho,Bateman,86,i'm thinking dorsia.
491,American-Psycho,Bateman,87,nice?
492,American-Psycho,Bateman,88,"the question is do you like it, courtney? and will  you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a  boyfriend to eat there tonight."
493,American-Psycho,Bateman,89,eight?
494,American-Psycho,Bateman,90,"sounds like i'll have to. don't fall asleep, okay? wear  something fabulous. dorsia, remember?"
495,American-Psycho,Bateman,91,(both of his eyes are closed)  umm...yes...i know it's a little late but is it possible to  reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
496,American-Psycho,Bateman,92,is that donald trump's car?
497,American-Psycho,Bateman,93,"you know, courtney, you should take some more  lithium. or have a diet coke. some caffeine might get you  out of this slump."
498,American-Psycho,Bateman,94,j&b. straight.
499,American-Psycho,Bateman,95,yes.
500,American-Psycho,Bateman,96,"(examining a menu that says ""barcadia"" in large script)  yes, dear."
501,American-Psycho,Bateman,97,"courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter  soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. new york magazine  called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" you'll  love it. and then...the red snapper with violets and  pine nuts. i think that'll follow nicely."
502,American-Psycho,Bateman,98,"yes, luis is a despicable twit. i hate him."
503,American-Psycho,Bateman,99,is it a what?
504,American-Psycho,Bateman,100,i'm ignoring you.
505,American-Psycho,Bateman,101,"(slowing down but not stopping) what do you want, courtney?"
506,American-Psycho,Bateman,102,it's a plain end. i think.
507,American-Psycho,Bateman,103,oh jesus. i'm going home.
508,American-Psycho,Bateman,104,"it's a plain end, see? so?"
509,American-Psycho,Bateman,105,why?
510,American-Psycho,Bateman,106,"oh christ, this really isn't worth it. and see,  courtney, it's there for what? huh? tell us.  (he slaps her again lightly)  why is it pulled down half an inch?  so it can catch the force of the ejaculate!"
511,American-Psycho,Bateman,107,"see? happy? you dumb bitch? are you happy, you dumb bitch?"
512,American-Psycho,Bateman,108,"lucky, i guess."
513,American-Psycho,Bateman,109,uh huh.
514,American-Psycho,Bateman,110,(catching luis hand)  your compliment was sufficient luis.
515,American-Psycho,Bateman,111,i've been great. and you?
516,American-Psycho,Bateman,112,"(v.o.)  owen has mistaken me for this dickhead marcus halberstam.  it seems logical because marcus also works at p&p and in  fact does the same exact thing i do and he also has a  penchant for valentino suits and oliver peoples glasses.  marcus and i even go to the same barber, although i have  a slightly better haircut."
517,American-Psycho,Bateman,113,(nervous)  it's...it's...all right.
518,American-Psycho,Bateman,114,"oh well, you know."

523,American-Psycho,Bateman,119,"(barely able to breath, his voice a croak)  nice."
524,American-Psycho,Bateman,120,(v.o.) i can't believe that price prefers mcdermott's card to mine.
525,American-Psycho,Bateman,121,(choking with anxiety)  impressive. very nice. let's see paul owen's card.
526,American-Psycho,Bateman,122,"(v.o.)  look at that subtle off-white coloring. the tasteful thickness  of it. oh my god, it even has a watermark..."
527,American-Psycho,Bateman,123,(offering his hand) hello. pat bateman.

531,American-Psycho,Bateman,127,"(holding the bill just out of the man's reach)  why don't you get a job? if you're so hungry, why don't you  get a job?"
532,American-Psycho,Bateman,128,"why? were you drinking? is that why you lost it?  insider trading? just joking. no, really-were you drinking on  the job?"

536,American-Psycho,Bateman,132,"i know that, i know that. jeez, you're like a broken record.  i'm trying to help you."
537,American-Psycho,Bateman,133,"listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who  do have jobs? from people who do work?"
538,American-Psycho,Bateman,134,"listen, what's your name?"

543,American-Psycho,Bateman,139,"you reek. you reek of...shit. do you know that?  (shouting) goddammit, al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of  faggot. al...i'm sorry."
544,American-Psycho,Bateman,140,it's just that...i don't know i don't have anything in common  with you.

546,American-Psycho,Bateman,142,there's a quarter. go buy some gum.
547,American-Psycho,Bateman,143,"(v.o.)  i have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood,  skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except  for greed ,und disgust. something horrible is happening inside  me and i don't know why."
548,American-Psycho,Bateman,144,"(v.o.)  my nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. i feel lethal,  on the verge of frenzy."
549,American-Psycho,Bateman,145,(v.o.)  i think my mask of sanity is about to slip.
550,American-Psycho,Bateman,146,marcus halberstam. for two at eight?
551,American-Psycho,Bateman,147,"j&b, straight. and a dixie beer."
552,American-Psycho,Bateman,148,not if you want to keep your spleen.
553,American-Psycho,Bateman,149,"listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous  here."
554,American-Psycho,Bateman,150,"hey, i'm a child of divorce. give me a break  (studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood)  hmmm, i see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello."
555,American-Psycho,Bateman,151,nobody goes there anymore.
556,American-Psycho,Bateman,152,"is that ivana trump over there? (laughs) jeez  patrick i mean marcus, what are you thinking? why would ivana  be at texarkana?"
557,American-Psycho,Bateman,153,"so, wasn't rothschild originally handling the  fisher account? how did you get it?"

561,American-Psycho,Bateman,157,"(talking to owen like a child)  paul, give me your amex card. good boy. bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check."
562,American-Psycho,Bateman,158,"two-hundred-and-fifty. very reasonable. let's leave  a big tip, shall we? my place hr a nightcap?"
563,American-Psycho,Bateman,159,"come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  (helping him into his jacket)  i've got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a  bottle of absolut waiting for us."
564,American-Psycho,Bateman,160,you like huey lewis and the news?
565,American-Psycho,Bateman,161,"(said partly from the bathroom)  the whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of  consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall.  he walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching owen  from behind ail the time."
566,American-Psycho,Bateman,162,"he's been compared to elvis costello but i think  huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor."
567,American-Psycho,Bateman,163,"yes, owen?"
568,American-Psycho,Bateman,164,"no, owen."
569,American-Psycho,Bateman,165,"yes, it is."
570,American-Psycho,Bateman,166,"in 1987 huey released this, fore!, their most  accomplished album. i think i heir undisputed masterpiece is  ""hip to be square,"" a song so catchy that most people probably  don't listen to the lyrics. but they should because it's not  just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of  trends. it's al~ a personal statement about the band itself."
571,American-Psycho,Bateman,167,crosses the room and picks up the ax.
572,American-Psycho,Bateman,168,"hey, paul?"
573,American-Psycho,Bateman,169,"(raising the ax and screaming)  try getting a reservation at dorsia now, you fucking  stupid bastard!"
574,American-Psycho,Bateman,170,(panting)  fucking bastard...
575,American-Psycho,Bateman,171,"drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby,  past the bored doorman, who looks up from the post for a moment."
576,American-Psycho,Bateman,172,is trying to hail a cab. owen's body is at his  feet. luis carruthers and a japanese girl walk up to him.
577,American-Psycho,Bateman,173,"no, luis. it's not me. you're mistaken."
578,American-Psycho,Bateman,174,commes des garcon.
579,American-Psycho,Bateman,175,"jesus lives, luis."
580,American-Psycho,Bateman,176,where to send the bastard? dallas? pans?
581,American-Psycho,Bateman,177,singapore? london. i'll send the asshole to london.
582,American-Psycho,Bateman,178,"hi, this is paul. i've been called away to london  for a few days. meredith, i'll call you when i get back.  hasta la vista, baby."
583,American-Psycho,Bateman,179,(faintly irritable)  what is it?
584,American-Psycho,Bateman,180,"(condescendingly)  ye-es, je-an?"
585,American-Psycho,Bateman,181,who?
586,American-Psycho,Bateman,182,tell him i'm at lunch.
587,American-Psycho,Bateman,183,"send him in, i guess. as she exits, he picks up the cordless  phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end."
588,American-Psycho,Bateman,184,"now, john, you've got to wear clothes in proportion  to your physique. there are definite do's and don'ts, good  buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. a hold-striped shirt  calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties..."
589,American-Psycho,Bateman,185,(realizing that kimball is staring at him)  right. and yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.
590,American-Psycho,Bateman,186,"listen, john, i've got to go. t boone pickens just  walked in... (he laughs inanely)  just joking... (pause)  no don't tip the owner of the salon. okay, john,  right, got it.  (he hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)  sorry about that."
591,American-Psycho,Bateman,187,oh that? just mulling over business problems.  examining opportunities...exchanging rumors... spreading gossip.
592,American-Psycho,Bateman,188,(shaking firmly)  hi. pat bateman. nice to meet you.
593,American-Psycho,Bateman,189,"(forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)  so, what's the topic of discussion?"
594,American-Psycho,Bateman,190,"you're not with the fbi or anything, are you?"
595,American-Psycho,Bateman,191,"ah, i see...yes. paul's disappearance...yes."
596,American-Psycho,Bateman,192,coffee?
597,American-Psycho,Bateman,193,perrier? san pellegrino?
598,American-Psycho,Bateman,194,can you bring mr...
599,American-Psycho,Bateman,195,mr. kimball a bottle of san pelle-
600,American-Psycho,Bateman,196,it's no problem
601,American-Psycho,Bateman,197,"well, what's the topic of discussion?"
602,American-Psycho,Bateman,198,"oh right. well, i haven't heard anything about the  disappearance or anything... (trying to laugh)  not on ""page six"" at least."
603,American-Psycho,Bateman,199,understandable.  (staring at the untouched bottle of san pellegrino)  lime?
604,American-Psycho,Bateman,200,you sure? i can always get you a lime.
605,American-Psycho,Bateman,201,shoot.
606,American-Psycho,Bateman,202,twenty-six. i'll be twenty-seven in october.
607,American-Psycho,Bateman,203,harvard. the harvard business school.
608,American-Psycho,Bateman,204,fifty-five west eighty-first street. the american gardens building.
609,American-Psycho,Bateman,205,(flattered)  thanks.
610,American-Psycho,Bateman,206,who do you ask?
611,American-Psycho,Bateman,207,nuprin?
612,American-Psycho,Bateman,208,bad habit.
613,American-Psycho,Bateman,209,"no, i guess it's okay."
614,American-Psycho,Bateman,210,no problem.  (buzzing jean)
615,American-Psycho,Bateman,211,"bring us an ashtray for mr. kimball, please. she whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence."
616,American-Psycho,Bateman,212,well...
617,American-Psycho,Bateman,213,"i'm...at a loss. he was part of that whole...yale thing,  you know."
618,American-Psycho,Bateman,214,yeah...yale thing.
619,American-Psycho,Bateman,215,"well, i think for one that he was probably a closet  homosexual. who did a lot of cocaine...that yale thing."
620,American-Psycho,Bateman,216,he led what i suppose was an orderly life. he... ate a balanced diet.
621,American-Psycho,Bateman,217,i hope i'm not being cross-examined here.
622,American-Psycho,Bateman,218,no. not really.
623,American-Psycho,Bateman,219,hang...out?
624,American-Psycho,Bateman,220,let me think. the newport. harry's. fluties. endochine. nell's. comell club. the new york yacht club. the regular  places.
625,American-Psycho,Bateman,221,"no, he just hung out there."
626,American-Psycho,Bateman,222,don't you know this?
627,American-Psycho,Bateman,223,we were both seven in 1969.
628,American-Psycho,Bateman,224,do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
629,American-Psycho,Bateman,225,"well, maybe he did, huh?"
630,American-Psycho,Bateman,226,but...has anyone seen him in london?
631,American-Psycho,Bateman,227,hmmm.
632,American-Psycho,Bateman,228,oh.
633,American-Psycho,Bateman,229,what?
634,American-Psycho,Bateman,230,yikes! no. paul wasn't into that. he followed a balanced  diet and-
635,American-Psycho,Bateman,231,have you consulted a psychic?
636,American-Psycho,Bateman,232,had his apartment been burglarized?
637,American-Psycho,Bateman,233,"i mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet  or anything, right?"
638,American-Psycho,Bateman,234,"that's so typical, isn't it?"
639,American-Psycho,Bateman,235,nothing.
640,American-Psycho,Bateman,236,the earth just opens up and swallows people.  (he checks his rolex)
641,American-Psycho,Bateman,237,(standing up)  you'll have to excuse me. i have a lunch meeting  with cliff huxtable at four seasons in twenty minutes.
642,American-Psycho,Bateman,238,"uh, no. there's one...down here."
643,American-Psycho,Bateman,239,yes. it's very good.
644,American-Psycho,Bateman,240,"absolutely, i'm 100% with you."
645,American-Psycho,Bateman,241,"you like that, slut?"
646,American-Psycho,Bateman,242,"you want to know what i'm wearing? sixty-dollar  boxer shorts by ralph lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white  cotton t-shirt by  commes des garcons.  (he snorts like a pig)  my rolex cost-"
647,American-Psycho,Bateman,243,"(whipering)  i'm a corporate raider. i orchestrate hostile takeovers. what do  you think of that?  (makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts)  huh, bitch?"
648,American-Psycho,Bateman,244,i haven't seen you around here.
649,American-Psycho,Bateman,245,would you like to see my apartment?
650,American-Psycho,Bateman,246,do you want to come to my apartment or not?
651,American-Psycho,Bateman,247,do you take american express?
652,American-Psycho,Bateman,248,do you take american express?
653,American-Psycho,Bateman,249,"i'm joking. come on, get in."
654,American-Psycho,Bateman,250,"i'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does  couples. couples. fifty-five west eighty-first, the  american gardens building. apartment 7c. and i really  can't stress blonde enough. blonde."
655,American-Psycho,Bateman,251,that's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking.
656,American-Psycho,Bateman,252,i want you to clean your vagina.
657,American-Psycho,Bateman,253,no. from behind. get on your knees.
658,American-Psycho,Bateman,254,i want to watch. you have a very nice body.
659,American-Psycho,Bateman,255,"thank you. send her up. christie, get out and dry  off, choose a robe-not the bijan and come and meet me and  our guest in the living room for drinks."
660,American-Psycho,Bateman,256,"you've arrived! how lovely, let me take your coat.  i'm paul. how good of you to come."
661,American-Psycho,Bateman,257,"not quite blonde, are you? more dirty blonde. i'm  going to call you sabrina. i'm paul owen."
662,American-Psycho,Bateman,258,"so, don't you want to know what i do?"
663,American-Psycho,Bateman,259,"well, i work on wall street. at pierce & pierce.  (long pause)  have you heard of it?"
664,American-Psycho,Bateman,260,"actually, that's none of your business, christie,  hut i can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap."
665,American-Psycho,Bateman,261,"no, no smoking. not in here."
666,American-Psycho,Bateman,262,varda truffle?
667,American-Psycho,Bateman,263,"i don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very  fine chardonnay you're not drinking."
668,American-Psycho,Bateman,264,"do you like phil collins? i've been a big genesis  fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, duke. before  that i really didn't understand any of their work. it was too  artsy, too intellectual. it was on duke where phil collins'  presence became more apparent. he puts aside the cd and takes out  another one."
669,American-Psycho,Bateman,265,"i think ""invisible touch"" is the group's undisputed masterpiece."
670,American-Psycho,Bateman,266,"it's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the  same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding  three albums. christie, take off the robe."
671,American-Psycho,Bateman,267,"listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of banks,  collins and rutherford. you can practically hear every nuance  of every instrument. sabrina, remove your dress."
672,American-Psycho,Bateman,268,"in terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer  songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.  sabrina, why don't you dance a little?"
673,American-Psycho,Bateman,269,"take the lyrics to ""land of confusion."" in this  song, phil collins addresses the problem of abusive political  authority."
674,American-Psycho,Bateman,270,"""in too deep"" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about  monogamy and commitment. the song is extremely uplifting.  their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything  i've heard in rock."
675,American-Psycho,Bateman,271,"christie, get down on your knees, so sabrina can see your  asshole."
676,American-Psycho,Bateman,272,"phill collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and  therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially  songs like ""in the air tonight"" and ""against  all odds."" sabrina, don't just stare at it. eat it."
677,American-Psycho,Bateman,273,"but i also think that phill collins works better  within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and  i stress the word artist. this is ""sussudio,"" a great,  great song, a personal favorite."
678,American-Psycho,Bateman,274,don't touch the rolex.
679,American-Psycho,Bateman,275,we're not through yet...
680,American-Psycho,Bateman,276,what an asshole.
681,American-Psycho,Bateman,277,i know her. i knew her.
682,American-Psycho,Bateman,278,how did you guess?
683,American-Psycho,Bateman,279,"thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy  personality."
684,American-Psycho,Bateman,280,"well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? what if  they have a good personality?  (he smiles giving up)  i know, i know-"
685,American-Psycho,Bateman,281,do you know what ed gein said about women?
686,American-Psycho,Bateman,282,"no, serial killer, wisconsin in the fifties. he was  an interesting guy."
687,American-Psycho,Bateman,283,"he said, ""when i see a pretty girl walking down the  street i think two things. one part of me wants to take her  out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat  her right."""
688,American-Psycho,Bateman,284,what her head would look like on a stick.
689,American-Psycho,Bateman,285,"(suddenly angry)  is that all you ever have to contribute, van patten? ""what about  fucking dinner?"""
690,American-Psycho,Bateman,286,(watching luis going into the men's room)  keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.
691,American-Psycho,Bateman,287,excuse me.
692,American-Psycho,Bateman,288,(hissing)  what...is...it?
693,American-Psycho,Bateman,289,(stumbling away from him)  i've gotta...i've  gotta...return some videotapes.
694,American-Psycho,Bateman,290,what? carruthers  (silently mouthing the words)  i'll call you.
695,American-Psycho,Bateman,291,maybe.
696,American-Psycho,Bateman,292,"dinner at the river cafe. au bar afterwards, maybe."
697,American-Psycho,Bateman,293,you and...luis?
698,American-Psycho,Bateman,294,i never knew you smoked.
699,American-Psycho,Bateman,295,"you look marvelous. there's nothing to say. you're  going to marry luis. next week, no less."
700,American-Psycho,Bateman,296,"yes, courtney?"
701,American-Psycho,Bateman,297,(flatly)  you too.
702,American-Psycho,Bateman,298,yes?
703,American-Psycho,Bateman,299,detective kendall...uh campbell? kimball  kimball.  (extending his hand)  call me don.
704,American-Psycho,Bateman,300,don.
705,American-Psycho,Bateman,301,"uh, yes...i mean...whenever necessary. you  know."
706,American-Psycho,Bateman,302,"how's the investigation going? taken anyone  in for ""formal questioning?"" (he makes quotation marks  in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)"
707,American-Psycho,Bateman,303,"yeah. no finlandia, as usual. fucking dump."
708,American-Psycho,Bateman,304,"dan, great to see you again. like i said, you need  anything at all, i'm your man. i don't envy your job. i mean  owen was a...complex man."
709,American-Psycho,Bateman,305,(holding up his hand to high-five) rasta man!
710,American-Psycho,Bateman,306,i mean-mon. we be jammin'...
711,American-Psycho,Bateman,307,(to daisy)  ask me a question.
712,American-Psycho,Bateman,308,what do you think i do?
713,American-Psycho,Bateman,309,"no. flattering, but no."
714,American-Psycho,Bateman,310,"i m into, well, murders and executions mostly."
715,American-Psycho,Bateman,311,"welt...it depends, why?"
716,American-Psycho,Bateman,312,"so, where do you work out?"
717,American-Psycho,Bateman,313,leaving what?
718,American-Psycho,Bateman,314,"don't, i'll drink it."
719,American-Psycho,Bateman,315,where to? are you going to go get a gram?
720,American-Psycho,Bateman,316,don't tell me...merchant banking?
721,American-Psycho,Bateman,317,(laughing)  where to? morgan stanley? rehab? what?
722,American-Psycho,Bateman,318,price! come back!
723,American-Psycho,Bateman,319,oh really? daisy  he said... (she laughs)  he said you gave him bad vibes.
724,American-Psycho,Bateman,320,that's...that's too bad.
725,American-Psycho,Bateman,321,what?
726,American-Psycho,Bateman,322,(insincerely) no. i really don't.
727,American-Psycho,Bateman,323,doesn't respond. we see that every space on the  puzzle has been filled in with the words meat or bone. jean  drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.
728,American-Psycho,Bateman,324,jean?
729,American-Psycho,Bateman,325,would you like to accompany me to dinner?
730,American-Psycho,Bateman,326,that is...if you're not doing anything.
731,American-Psycho,Bateman,327,"(lowering his wayfarers)  well, isn't this a coincidence."
732,American-Psycho,Bateman,328,"listen, where should we go?"
733,American-Psycho,Bateman,329,let's not think about what i want. how about  anywhere you want.
734,American-Psycho,Bateman,330,"no, come on. anywhere you want."
735,American-Psycho,Bateman,331,come on. where do you want to go? anywhere you want. just say it. i can get us in anywhere.
736,American-Psycho,Bateman,332,soooo...dorsia is where jean wants to go...
737,American-Psycho,Bateman,333,dorsia is...fine.
738,American-Psycho,Bateman,334,"yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at  nine o'clock?"
739,American-Psycho,Bateman,335,oh really? that's great.
740,American-Psycho,Bateman,336,two at nine? perfect.
741,American-Psycho,Bateman,337,see you then.
742,American-Psycho,Bateman,338,yes? you're dressed...okay.
743,American-Psycho,Bateman,339,they know me.
744,American-Psycho,Bateman,340,"why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock  for drinks, okay?"
745,American-Psycho,Bateman,341,and jean? you'll want to change before we go out.
746,American-Psycho,Bateman,342,jean? sorbet?
747,American-Psycho,Bateman,343,i'm on a diet. but thank you.
748,American-Psycho,Bateman,344,(weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness)  you can always he thinner. look...better.
749,American-Psycho,Bateman,345,no. it's all right. i'm not very good at controlling  it anyway.
750,American-Psycho,Bateman,346,"so listen, what do you really want to do with your  life?"
751,American-Psycho,Bateman,347,"and don't tell me you enjoy working with children,  okay?"
752,American-Psycho,Bateman,348,do you have a boyfriend?
753,American-Psycho,Bateman,349,interesting.
754,American-Psycho,Bateman,350,"maybe. i don't know not really. bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very  bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape,  twine and a nail gun."
755,American-Psycho,Bateman,351,"jean, do you feel...fulfilled? i mean, in your life?"
756,American-Psycho,Bateman,352,growing. i'm glad you said that.
757,American-Psycho,Bateman,353,"did you know that ted bundy's first dog, a collie,  was named lassie? had you heard this?"
758,American-Psycho,Bateman,354,forget it.
759,American-Psycho,Bateman,355,"oh. uh, tape. duct tape. i...need it for... taping something. bateman goes back to the cupboard for the  nail gun."
760,American-Psycho,Bateman,356,(looking up from loading nails into the gun)  what...no! put it in the carton.
761,American-Psycho,Bateman,357,jean? what?
762,American-Psycho,Bateman,358,i'm looking for...i guess you could say i just  want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
763,American-Psycho,Bateman,359,yes. i don t think i can...control myself.
764,American-Psycho,Bateman,360,"if you stay, i think something bad will happen. i  think i might hurt you.  (almost hopefully)  you don't want to get hurt, do you?"
765,American-Psycho,Bateman,361,thanks. it slipped my mind completely.
766,American-Psycho,Bateman,362,"kimball-i've been wanting to talk with you, come  into my office. jean, great jacket. matsuda?"
767,American-Psycho,Bateman,363,"yeah, gone into rehab. shame.  (hopefully)  is he a suspect?"
768,American-Psycho,Bateman,364,god...i guess...i was probably returning  videotapes.
769,American-Psycho,Bateman,365,i had a date with a girl named veronica.
770,American-Psycho,Bateman,366,what?
771,American-Psycho,Bateman,367,well...i...wait...what information have  you received?
772,American-Psycho,Bateman,368,"well, i could he wrong."
773,American-Psycho,Bateman,369,"(clearly nervous and under pressure)  we had...gone to a new musical called...oh africa, brave africa. it  was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. i think we had dinner  at orso's. no, petaluma. no, orso's. the...last time i  physically saw him was...at an automated teller. i can't  remember which...just one that was near, um, nell's."
774,American-Psycho,Bateman,370,"patrick, please. i hope i've been informative. long  day-a bit scattered."
775,American-Psycho,Bateman,371,"great, yes, i'd like that."
776,American-Psycho,Bateman,372,absolutely. i'm with you on that one.
777,American-Psycho,Bateman,373,never. i mean...i don't really like... singers.
778,American-Psycho,Bateman,374,"no, i like music. just-they're-huey's too... black sounding. for me."
779,American-Psycho,Bateman,375,i'll be there.
780,American-Psycho,Bateman,376,"oh this won't be anything like last time, i promise."
781,American-Psycho,Bateman,377,just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.
782,American-Psycho,Bateman,378,"nothing like last time, promise."
783,American-Psycho,Bateman,379,"(chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)  so, you're looking great, how have you been?"
784,American-Psycho,Bateman,380,(mock shock)  really?
785,American-Psycho,Bateman,381,"oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. here."
786,American-Psycho,Bateman,382,bitch.
787,American-Psycho,Bateman,383,"uh uh uh. half now, half later."
788,American-Psycho,Bateman,384,"okay, your name is christie. we're meeting a friend of mine,  elizabeth. she'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.  you'll like her. she's a very nice girl. don't say anything  about yourself. is that clear. christie?"
789,American-Psycho,Bateman,385,(offended that she prefers owen's apartment)  it's not that nice.
790,American-Psycho,Bateman,386,"what do you mean, she was a hot number."
791,American-Psycho,Bateman,387,she's my...cousin.
792,American-Psycho,Bateman,388,she's from...france.
793,American-Psycho,Bateman,389,"elizabeth, it's three in the morning."
794,American-Psycho,Bateman,390,don't tell him you're here.
795,American-Psycho,Bateman,391,(whispering)  you're at paul owen s.
796,American-Psycho,Bateman,392,(whispering)  paul owen.
797,American-Psycho,Bateman,393,no.
798,American-Psycho,Bateman,394,"listen, i would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.  what's wrong with that? it's totally disease-free."
799,American-Psycho,Bateman,395,come on. don't you find christie attractive?
800,American-Psycho,Bateman,396,come on. i think it would be a turn-on.
801,American-Psycho,Bateman,397,"christie, you're not drinking your wine."
802,American-Psycho,Bateman,398,(to elizabeth)  are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
803,American-Psycho,Bateman,399,"well, you went to sarah lawrence for one thing."
804,American-Psycho,Bateman,400,"did you know that whitney houston's debut lp  called simply whitney houston had four number-one singles  on it? did you know that, christie? whitney's voice leaps  across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's  mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album  on a first listening."
805,American-Psycho,Bateman,401,"(ignoring her)  it's hard to choose a favorite track  among so many great ones, but ""the greatest love of all""  is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about  self-preservation and dignity. it's universal message  crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope  that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder.  since, elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in  to empathize with others, we can always empathize with  ourselves."
806,American-Psycho,Bateman,402,"it's an important message, crucial, really, and it's  beautifully stated on the album."
807,American-Psycho,Bateman,403,"not the face, you bitch. not the fucking face, you  piece of bitch trash!"
808,American-Psycho,Bateman,404,"i think, evelyn, that we've...lost touch."
809,American-Psycho,Bateman,405,"(speaking very carefully, measuring each word)  my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale  cannot be, um, corrected, but i have no other way to fulfill  my needs."
810,American-Psycho,Bateman,406,we need to talk.
811,American-Psycho,Bateman,407,"it's over, evelyn. it's all over"
812,American-Psycho,Bateman,408,i'm fucking serious. it's fucking over. us. this  is no joke. i don't think we should see each other anymore.
813,American-Psycho,Bateman,409,(brushing her hand away)  i know that your friends are my friends. i've thought about  that. you can have them.
814,American-Psycho,Bateman,410,"yes, i am."
815,American-Psycho,Bateman,411,we never really shared one.
816,American-Psycho,Bateman,412,"i'm...in touch with humanity. evelyn, i'm sorry.  (he pauses, as if searching for the right words)  you're just not terribly important to me."
817,American-Psycho,Bateman,413,i know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
818,American-Psycho,Bateman,414,"(looking uncomfortably around the room)  if you really want to do something for me, you can stop making  this scene right now."
819,American-Psycho,Bateman,415,i'm leaving now. i've assessed the situation and i'm going.
820,American-Psycho,Bateman,416,i'm just leaving.
821,American-Psycho,Bateman,417,i have to return some videotapes.
822,American-Psycho,Bateman,418,"here kitty, kitty."
823,American-Psycho,Bateman,419,"harold, it's bateman. patrick bateman. you're my  lawyer so i think you should know-i've killed a lot of  people. some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some  homeless people, maybe five or ten, an nyu girl i met in  central park. i left her in a parking lot, near dunkin'  donuts. i killed bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail  gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. last week i  killed another girl with a chainsaw-i had to, she almost  got away there was someone else there, maybe a model, i  can't remember but she's dead too. and paul owen. i killed  paul owen with an ax, in the face. his body is dissolving  in a bathtub in hell's kitchen. i don't want to leave anything  out here...i guess i've killed 20 people, maybe 40-i have tapes  of a lot of it. some of the girls have seen the tapes, i even... well, i ate some of their brains and i tried to cook a little.  tonight i just, well, i had to kill a lot of people and i'm not  sure i 'm going to get away with it this time-i mean i guess  i'm a pretty sick guy. so-if you get hack tomorrow, i may show  up at harry's bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open."
824,American-Psycho,Bateman,420,"not in the mood, i guess."
825,American-Psycho,Bateman,421,"(deliberately nonchalant)  yes, of course. the hash browns are delicious. i'm just...not... ordering them."
826,American-Psycho,Bateman,422,i'm not really sure. i had a shower...and some  sorbet?
827,American-Psycho,Bateman,423,but how? where do you place paul that night?
828,American-Psycho,Bateman,424,and?
829,American-Psycho,Bateman,425,marcus?
830,American-Psycho,Bateman,426,but marcus denied it?
831,American-Psycho,Bateman,427,"well, does marcus have an alibi?"
832,American-Psycho,Bateman,428,he does? you're sure?
833,American-Psycho,Bateman,429,oh. kimball now where were you?  (he laughs)
834,American-Psycho,Bateman,430,(laughing with him)  where was marcus?
835,American-Psycho,Bateman,431,so who was he with?
836,American-Psycho,Bateman,432,"oh, right. of course...we had wanted paul owen  to come. but he said he had plans...i guess i had dinner  with victoria...the following night."
837,American-Psycho,Bateman,433,20b.
838,American-Psycho,Bateman,434,mrs. wolfe?
839,American-Psycho,Bateman,435,no.
840,American-Psycho,Bateman,436,i'm looking for...paul owen's...place.
841,American-Psycho,Bateman,437,doesn't he live here?
842,American-Psycho,Bateman,438,are you sure?
843,American-Psycho,Bateman,439,"no. yes. i mean yes, i did. in the times. but... doesn't paul owen still live here?"
844,American-Psycho,Bateman,440,but i think...i want to know what happened  here.
845,American-Psycho,Bateman,441,i won't...don't worry.
846,American-Psycho,Bateman,442,jean? hello? jean?
847,American-Psycho,Bateman,443,"hello? jean, i need help!"
848,American-Psycho,Bateman,444,jean-i'm not-
849,American-Psycho,Bateman,445,"oh god, what did you say, you dumb bitch?"
850,American-Psycho,Bateman,446,what are i doing?
851,American-Psycho,Bateman,447,"i don't think i'm gonna make it, jean."
852,American-Psycho,Bateman,448,...to the office this afternoon.
853,American-Psycho,Bateman,449,(screaming)  just...say...no!
854,American-Psycho,Bateman,450,stop sounding so fucking sad! jesus!
855,American-Psycho,Bateman,451,(on automatic)  i'm not going anywhere unless we  have a reservation.
856,American-Psycho,Bateman,452,"(he downs his drink)  excuse me, gentlemen. right back. he approaches carnes cautiously."
857,American-Psycho,Bateman,453,"shut up, carnes, they will not."
858,American-Psycho,Bateman,454,"so, harold, did you get my message?"
859,American-Psycho,Bateman,455,"(waving smoke out of his face)  yes, naturally."
860,American-Psycho,Bateman,456,what exactly do you mean?
861,American-Psycho,Bateman,457,"but wait, harold, what do you mean?"
862,American-Psycho,Bateman,458,carnes? wait.
863,American-Psycho,Bateman,459,what are you talking about? bateman is what?
864,American-Psycho,Bateman,460,"(desperate, shouting)  wait. stop. you don't seem to understand. you're not really  comprehending any of this. i killed him. i did it, carnes.  i'm patrick bateman. i chopped owen's fucking head off.  i tortured dozens of girls. the whole message i left on your  machine was true."
865,American-Psycho,Bateman,461,"no! listen, don't you know who i am? i'm not davis, i'm  patrick bateman! i talk to you on the phone all the time!  don't you recognize me? you're my lawyer."
866,American-Psycho,Bateman,462,"now, carnes, listen to me. listen very, very carefully. i killed  paul owen and i liked it. i can't make myself any clearer"
867,American-Psycho,Bateman,463,it never was supposed to he! why isn't it possible?
868,American-Psycho,Bateman,464,"why not, you stupid bastard?"
869,American-Psycho,Bateman,465,"no, you...didn't?"
870,American-Psycho,Bateman,466,"i'm just a happy camper. rockin' and a-rollin'. van patten  (to price) rehab's done wonders for you, pal.  working for unicef now?"
871,American-Psycho,Bateman,467,(v.o.)  but inside doesn't matter...
872,American-Psycho,Bateman,468,whatever.
873,American-Psycho,Bateman,469,"(v.o.) there are no more barriers to cross. all i have in common with  the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil,  all the mayhem i have caused and my utter indifference toward  it, i have now surpassed..."
874,American-Psycho,Bateman,470,(v.o.) my pain is constant and sharp and i do not hope for a better  world for anyone. i fact i want my pain to be inflicted on  others. i want no escape.
875,American-Psycho,Bateman,471,"(v.o.) but even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. i gain no  deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted  from my telling. there has been no reason for me to tell you any  of this. this confession has meant nothing..."
349,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,0,no.
350,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,1,we don't need them.
351,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,2,"we'll leave them. once we've got it,  we'll be able to reach the plane by  dusk."
352,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,3,"if they knew we were here, they would  have killed us already."
353,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,4,so this is where forrestal cashed  in.
354,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,5,"competitor. he was good, very good."
355,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,6,no one ever had what we have...  partners.
356,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,7,(back turned) assuming that pillar there marks the  corner and...
357,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,8,let's go.
358,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,9,forrestal.
359,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,10,"now, satipo, we don't want to be  discouraged by every little thing."
360,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,11,(taking torch) let me see that.
361,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,12,try not to touch the vines.
362,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,13,that's what scares me.
363,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,14,you wait here.
364,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,15,adios.
365,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,16,"(eyeing the hovitos) too bad they don't know you like i  do, belloq."
366,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,17,(yelling) get it going! get it going!
367,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,18,go!
368,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,19,i can't stand snakes.
369,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,20,i hate them.
370,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,21,i don't know. just because belloq  had it doesn't mean he kept it.
371,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,22,getting it away from those indians  would be a neat trick (a hard look) i hope they got him.
372,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,23,"that's all right, phil. thanks a  lot."
373,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,24,no. i'll see you thursday.
374,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,25,"hey, if you don't like them, i can  always return them."
375,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,26,then what's wrong?
376,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,27,what kind of people?
377,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,28,(concerned) government?
378,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,29,i've already served.
379,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,30,(nods) we haven't spoken in ten years. i'm  afraid we had a bit of a falling  out.
380,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,31,"(negative) just rumors. somewhere in asia, last  i heard."
381,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,32,i understand.
382,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,33,(to himself) tanis. ain't that somethin'!
383,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,34,"ah, ravenwood's no nazi."
384,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,35,they're looking for the headpiece to  the staff of ra.
385,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,36,only half of it. ravenwood had the  other half.
386,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,37,it all has to do with the ark of the  covenant. (the army guys look  mystified) the chest the hebrews used to carry  around the ten commandments.
387,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,38,"an egyptian pharaoh stole the ark  from jerusalem and took it back to  the city of tanis. a short time later,  tanis was consumed by the desert in  a sandstorm that lasted a year. but  before that, the pharaoh had had the  ark hidden away in a secret chamber  called the well of the souls. which  is where the staff of ra comes in."
388,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,39,"now this was rather clever. the staff  was really just a big stick - oh, i  don't know, say like this - (he indicates about  six feet) no one really knows for sure. any  way, it was capped by an elaborate  headpiece with a carving of the sun  at the top. what you had to do was  take the staff to a special map room  in tanis - it had the whole city  laid out in miniature on the floor.  when you placed the staff in a certain  spot in this room, at a certain time  of day, the sun would shine through  a hole here in the headpiece and  then send a beam of light down here -  to the map - giving you the location  of the well of the souls..."
389,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,40,(nods) which is probably what the nazis are  after.
390,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,41,"look like? why, it's right here..."
391,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,42,yes. that's what the hebrews thought.
392,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,43,who knows... lightning... fire...  the power of god.
393,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,44,"oh yes. the bible tells of it leveling  mountains and wasting entire regions.  moses promised that when the ark was  with you, ""your enemies will be  scattered and your foes fell before  you"". (pause) an army which carries the ark before  it is invincible."
394,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,45,"oh, there's one other thing that  hitler undoubtably believes about  the ark... (a long pregnant pause) it's said that the lost ark will be  recovered at the time of the coming  of the true messiah."
395,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,46,most certainly.
396,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,47,this isn't really a good time.
397,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,48,all right. come on in.
398,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,49,i'll be in a minute.
399,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,50,"(smiles) good work, marcus. i had a feeling  this would happen. and, of course,  the museum gets the ark when we're  done."
400,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,51,"okay, here's the way it's gonna be.  first, i'll high-tail it to shanghai  and get the piece from general hok.  then i think i know where i can find  ravenwood. if only i can get -"
401,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,52,i'll worry about that when the time  comes. my only hope is to find the  well of the souls before the nazis  do.
402,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,53,what's the hurry?
403,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,54,(he's felt better) great. got it.
404,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,55,i've got to get to nepal.
405,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,56,"hello, marion."
406,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,57,"nice to see you, too."
407,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,58,(getting up) take it easy. i'm looking for your  father.
408,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,59,what happened?
409,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,60,do you find him?
410,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,61,not a bad way to go. doing what he  loved.
411,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,62,why not leave? go back to the states.
412,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,63,where you gonna get it?
413,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,64,i need one of the pieces your father  collected.
414,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,65,i never meant to hurt you.
415,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,66,you knew what you were doing.
416,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,67,i guess that depends on your  definition.
417,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,68,"look, i did what i did. i don't expect  you to be happy about it. but maybe  we can do each other some good."
418,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,69,shut up and listen for a second. i  want that piece your father had.  i've got money.
419,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,70,enough to get you back to the states.  where are his things?
420,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,71,everything?
421,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,72,(giving up) that's too bad.
422,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,73,seltzer.
423,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,74,"you're a tough broad now, aren't  you?"
424,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,75,i can only say i'm sorry so many  times.
425,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,76,"a bronze piece, about this size. in  the shape of the sun. probably broken  off at the bottom. has a little hole  in it, off-center. does that sound  familiar?"
426,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,77,do you know where it is?
427,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,78,three thousand. american.
428,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,79,maybe.
429,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,80,"okay, five thousand. that's all i  can give you now. i can get you more  when you land in the states."
430,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,81,"i'm back, aren't i?"
431,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,82,you can trust me.
432,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,83,why?
433,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,84,i trust you.
434,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,85,i've heard that.
435,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,86,"(moving back) bossy, aren't you?"
436,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,87,tomorrow.
437,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,88,hello.
438,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,89,let's get out of here!
439,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,90,it's here?
440,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,91,forget it! i want you out of here.  now!
441,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,92,let's go!
442,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,93,(figuratively) i owe you plenty!
443,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,94,(smiles) you're something!
444,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,95,"i knew the germans would hire you,  sallah. they couldn't have an  excavation in the desert without the  best digger in egypt."
445,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,96,tell me about the map room at tanis.
446,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,97,those nazis are moving awfully fast.
447,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,98,belloq. so he got away from the  indians. this is going to be more  interesting that i thought.
448,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,99,(indicates the  headpiece) even belloq won't be able to find it  without that. can you make anything  of those markings? they're nothing  i'm familiar with.
449,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,100,"what is it, my friend?"
450,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,101,do you really need that monkey?
451,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,102,and your brains.
452,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,103,(dragging marion on) he'll be ok. come on. come on.
453,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,104,(to marion) run! get out of here!
454,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,105,"go, dammit! go!"
455,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,106,marion.
456,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,107,(doesn't even look) too bad. i'm drinking alone.
457,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,108,belloq.
458,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,109,i ought to kill you right now.
459,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,110,not a very private place for a murder.
460,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,111,try the local sewer.
461,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,112,now you're getting nasty.
462,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,113,"what about your boss, der fuhrer? i  thought he was waiting to take  possession."
463,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,114,"i hope your friends are patient.  dangerous work, belloq."
464,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,115,"tell me, did you get away with the  idol?"
465,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,116,"you know, if it's god you want to  talk to, maybe i can arrange it."
466,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,117,"yes. yes, i'll come now."
467,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,118,(nods) thanks you. (grave) marion's dead.
468,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,119,and they made the calculation in the  map room?
469,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,120,(resigned) the well of the souls.
470,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,121,just want i need.
471,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,122,how 'bout the height of the staff?  did belloq get it off of there?
472,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,123,you said their top section was blank.  are you absolutely sure?
473,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,124,belloq's staff is seven and a half  inches short. they're digging in the  wrong spot!
474,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,125,my god! they aren't kidding!
475,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,126,what time does the sun hit the map?
476,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,127,we haven't got much time. where are  the germans digging for the well of  the souls?
477,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,128,okay. let's go.
478,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,129,"(stage whisper) sallah. (he waits, then louder) sallah!"
479,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,130,(loudest) sallah!
480,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,131,i though you were dead.
481,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,132,they must have switched baskets.  thank god for that! bless those  bastards. have they hurt you?
482,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,133,(putting the knife  away) i have to leave you here for a little  while. i know where the ark is. if i  take you out of here they'll start  combing the place for us.
483,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,134,keep your voice down.
484,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,135,"look, you don't know how glad i am  to see you. and i don't like doing  this. but the whole thing will be  shot if you don't just sit here  quietly. they haven't hurt you in  the last twenty-four hours, they  aren't going to start now. i'll be  back to get you in no time."
485,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,136,there!
486,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,137,the ark must be in that stone case.  what's that gray stuff all over the  floor -
487,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,138,why snakes? why did it have to be  snakes? anything else.
488,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,139,lots of torches. and oil. i want a  landing strip down there.
489,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,140,don't touch it! never touch it!
490,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,141,hurry up! why did it have to be  snakes?
491,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,142,what the -
492,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,143,why don't you fellows come down here?  i'll show you.
493,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,144,don't panic. there's plenty of time  for that later. wave that at anything  that slithers.
494,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,145,just watch the floor.
495,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,146,(he spots something) there!
496,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,147,come on!
497,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,148,stay here!
498,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,149,i'll be back in a minute. we're going  through this wall.
499,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,150,just keep your eyes open and get  ready to run. no matter what happens  to me.
500,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,151,come on!
501,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,152,i guess not. i think i'd be dead.
502,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,153,absolutely.
503,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,154,out.
504,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,155,don't do that. it scares me.
505,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,156,look!
506,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,157,"when the ark gets loaded, we're  already going to be on that plane."
507,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,158,get out! get out!
508,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,159,where is it?
509,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,160,"you two get back to cairo quick and  get us transportation to england - a  plane, a ship, anything."
510,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,161,i'm going to get that truck. i'll  meet you at omar's. be ready for me.
511,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,162,(still searching) i don't know. i'm making this up as  i go.
512,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,163,it's lovely.
513,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,164,that's what you look like.
514,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,165,what would you like to recapture?
515,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,166,did i ever say i was sorry i burned  down your tavern?
516,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,167,you saved my life.
517,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,168,seems things have worked out kind of  even.
518,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,169,maybe we should consider all past  accounts closed.
519,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,170,what else?
520,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,171,the engines have shut down.
521,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,172,i'm going to find out.
522,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,173,what's wrong?
523,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,174,holy shit.
524,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,175,damn!
525,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,176,hold it. (the nazi react) one move from anybody and i blow  that box back to moses.
526,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,177,what about you? talked to god yet? (belloq's eyes flash) where's the girl?
527,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,178,that depends on how reasonable we're  all willing to be. all i want is the  girl. we'll keep possession of the  ark only till we've got safe transport  to england. then it's all yours.
528,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,179,then the ark and some of us are going  up in a big bang. i don't think hitler  would like that a bit. now i don't  want to talk about this anymore.  show me that girl in five seconds or -
529,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,180,it's a bad habit. i'm trying to break  it.
530,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,181,"thanks. if you talk to him, tell him  i'm on my way up."
531,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,182,"marion! marion, can you hear me?"
532,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,183,hi.
533,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,184,glad i could make it.
534,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,185,let's get out of here.
535,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,186,are you game?
536,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,187,(grins at her) okay. let's do it.
537,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,188,"whatever you do, don't touch it.  let's put it on the floor."
538,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,189,we'll go down that side. shoot anyone  who looks at us crosseyed.
539,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,190,(to marion) get down!
540,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,191,(heated) that's a powerful force. research  should be done -
541,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,192,who?
542,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,193,we may be able to help.
543,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,194,"yeah, like what?"
544,Indiana Jones Raiders,Indy,195,it's not the ark... but it'll have  to do.
1,Finding Nemo,Marlin,0,wow.
2,Finding Nemo,Marlin,1,wow.
3,Finding Nemo,Marlin,2,wow.
4,Finding Nemo,Marlin,3,"so, coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna get the whole ocean, did you? huh? [sighs] oh yeah. a fish can breath out here. did your man deliver or did he deliver?"
5,Finding Nemo,Marlin,4,and it wasn't so easy.
6,Finding Nemo,Marlin,5,you better believe they did--every single one of them.
7,Finding Nemo,Marlin,6,"so, you do like it, don't you?"
8,Finding Nemo,Marlin,7,"coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. they deserve the best. look, look, look. they'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! see, right by their bedroom window."
9,Finding Nemo,Marlin,8,"oh, right. right."
10,Finding Nemo,Marlin,9,"you wanna name all of 'em, right now? all right, we'll name this half marlin jr. and then this half coral jr. okay, we're done."
11,Finding Nemo,Marlin,10,"nemo? well, we'll name one nemo but i'd like most of them to be marlin jr."
12,Finding Nemo,Marlin,11,yeah. what if they don't like me?
13,Finding Nemo,Marlin,12,"no, really."
14,Finding Nemo,Marlin,13,you remember how we met?
15,Finding Nemo,Marlin,14,"well, i remember. 'excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'"
16,Finding Nemo,Marlin,15,
17,Finding Nemo,Marlin,16,here he is. cutie's here! where did everybody go?
18,Finding Nemo,Marlin,17,"[gasps] coral, get inside the house, coral. no, coral, don't. they'll be fine. just get inside, you, right now."
19,Finding Nemo,Marlin,18,no!
20,Finding Nemo,Marlin,19,coral! coral?
21,Finding Nemo,Marlin,20,coral? oh!
22,Finding Nemo,Marlin,21,"ohh. there, there, there. it's okay, daddy's here. daddy's got you. i promise, i will never let anything happen to you...nemo."
23,Finding Nemo,Marlin,22,i don't wanna go to school. five more minutes.
24,Finding Nemo,Marlin,23,okay...huh?
25,Finding Nemo,Marlin,24,"all right, i'm up."
26,Finding Nemo,Marlin,25,nemo!
27,Finding Nemo,Marlin,26,"[gasps] nemo, don't move! don't move! you'll never get out of there yourself. i'll do it. all right, where's the break? you feel a break?"
28,Finding Nemo,Marlin,27,"sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. now, any rushing fluids?"
29,Finding Nemo,Marlin,28,are you woozy?
30,Finding Nemo,Marlin,29,how many stripes do i have?
31,Finding Nemo,Marlin,30,answer the stripe question!
32,Finding Nemo,Marlin,31,"no! see, something's wrong with you. i have one, two, three--that's all i have? oh, you're okay. how's the lucky fin?"
33,Finding Nemo,Marlin,32,let's see.
34,Finding Nemo,Marlin,33,are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'cause there's no problem if you don't. you can wait 5 or 6 years.
35,Finding Nemo,Marlin,34,ah-ah-ah! forgot to brush.
36,Finding Nemo,Marlin,35,do you want this anemone to sting you?
37,Finding Nemo,Marlin,36,brush.
38,Finding Nemo,Marlin,37,you missed a spot.
39,Finding Nemo,Marlin,38,there. ha ha! right there. and here and here and here!
40,Finding Nemo,Marlin,39,"all right, we're excited. first day of school, here we go. we're ready to learn to get some knowledge. now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?"
41,Finding Nemo,Marlin,40,"that's my boy. so, first we check to see that the coast is clear. we go out and back in. and then we go out, and back in. and then one more time--out and back in. and sometimes, if you wanna do it four times--"
42,Finding Nemo,Marlin,41,"all right. come on, boy."
43,Finding Nemo,Marlin,42,
44,Finding Nemo,Marlin,43,"no, and i don't plan to."
45,Finding Nemo,Marlin,44,sea turtles? i don't know.
46,Finding Nemo,Marlin,45,"well, you know what, if i ever meet a sea turtle, i'll ask him. after i'm done talking to the shark, okay? whoa, whoa, whoa! hold on, hold on, wait to cross. hold my fin, hold my fin."
47,Finding Nemo,Marlin,46,"hey, that snail was about to charge. hmm, i wonder where we're supposed to go."
48,Finding Nemo,Marlin,47,"come on, we'll try over there."
49,Finding Nemo,Marlin,48,"excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?"
50,Finding Nemo,Marlin,49,"yes. shocking, i know."
51,Finding Nemo,Marlin,50,marlin.
52,Finding Nemo,Marlin,51,"well, actually, that's a common misconception. clownfish are no funnier than any other fish."
53,Finding Nemo,Marlin,52,"all right, i   know one joke. um, there's a mollusk, see? and he walks up to a sea, well he doesn't walk   up, he swims up. well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. he's in one place and then the   sea cucumber, well they--i mixed up. there was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. none of them   were walking, so forget that i--"
54,Finding Nemo,Marlin,53,i would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.
55,Finding Nemo,Marlin,54,that's where i would play
56,Finding Nemo,Marlin,55,"he was born with it, kids. we call it his lucky fin."
57,Finding Nemo,Marlin,56,"whoa, you better stay with me."
58,Finding Nemo,Marlin,57,"just so you know, he's got a little fin. i find if he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. ten, fifteen minutes."
59,Finding Nemo,Marlin,58,"bye, nemo!"
60,Finding Nemo,Marlin,59,"bye, son! be safe."
61,Finding Nemo,Marlin,60,"well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?"
62,Finding Nemo,Marlin,61,"they just gotta grow up--the drop off?! they're going to the drop off?! wh-what are you, insane?! why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?"
63,Finding Nemo,Marlin,62,"don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!"
64,Finding Nemo,Marlin,63,"nemo, no!"
65,Finding Nemo,Marlin,64,you were about to swim into open water!
66,Finding Nemo,Marlin,65,"it was a good thing i was here. if i hadn't showed up, i don't know--"
67,Finding Nemo,Marlin,66,"this does not concern you, kids. and you're lucky i don't tell your parents you were out there. you know you can't swim well."
68,Finding Nemo,Marlin,67,"no, it's not okay. you shouldn't be anywhere near here. okay, i was right. you'll start school in a year or two."
69,Finding Nemo,Marlin,68,"clearly, you're not ready. and you're not coming back until you are. you think you can do these things but you just can't, nemo!"
70,Finding Nemo,Marlin,69,i'm sorry. i didn't mean to interrupt things. he isn't a good swimmer and it's a little too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.
71,Finding Nemo,Marlin,70,"nemo! what do you think you're doing? you're gonna get stuck out there and i'll have to get you before another fish does! get back here! i said get back here, now! stop! you take one move, mister. don't youdare! if you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me? don't touch the bo--nemo!"
72,Finding Nemo,Marlin,71,"you paddle your little tail back here, nemo. that's right. you are in big trouble, young man. do you hear me? big...big--"
73,Finding Nemo,Marlin,72,"i'm coming, nemo!"
74,Finding Nemo,Marlin,73,"oh! nemo! unh! nemo! nemo, no! nemo! nemo! nemo! no! no! aah! nemo! nemo!"
75,Finding Nemo,Marlin,74,"oh no. no, no. it's gone, it's gone. no, no, it can't be gone. no, no! nemo! nemo! nemo! no! nemo! nemo! no! no, please, no! no, no!"
76,Finding Nemo,Marlin,75,"has anybody seen a boat!? please! a white boat! they took my son! my son! help me, please!"
77,Finding Nemo,Marlin,76,waaaah!
78,Finding Nemo,Marlin,77,"ooh, ooh..."
79,Finding Nemo,Marlin,78,"he's gone, he's gone.."
80,Finding Nemo,Marlin,79,he's gone.
81,Finding Nemo,Marlin,80,"no, no. they took him away. i have to find the boat."
82,Finding Nemo,Marlin,81,you have?
83,Finding Nemo,Marlin,82,a white one?
84,Finding Nemo,Marlin,83,where!? which way!?
85,Finding Nemo,Marlin,84,
86,Finding Nemo,Marlin,85,hey! wait!
87,Finding Nemo,Marlin,86,what?
88,Finding Nemo,Marlin,87,huh?
89,Finding Nemo,Marlin,88,wait a minute..
90,Finding Nemo,Marlin,89,what? you're showing me which way the boat went!
91,Finding Nemo,Marlin,90,"wait a minute, wait a minute! what is going on? you already told me which way the boat was going!"
92,Finding Nemo,Marlin,91,"if this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! and i know funny..i'm a clownfish!"
93,Finding Nemo,Marlin,92,short-term memory loss..i don't believe this!
94,Finding Nemo,Marlin,93,"something's wrong with you, really. you're wasting my time. i have to find my son. [gasps]"
95,Finding Nemo,Marlin,94,nothing. we're not doing anything. we're not even out.
96,Finding Nemo,Marlin,95,"parties are fun, and it's tempting but--"
97,Finding Nemo,Marlin,96,o-okay..that's all that matters.
98,Finding Nemo,Marlin,97,me? i don't have a problem.
99,Finding Nemo,Marlin,98,"okay. uh, hello. my name is marlin. i'm a clownfish--"
100,Finding Nemo,Marlin,99,"actually i do know one that's pretty good. there was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber. normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. so the sea mollusk says to the cucumber..."
101,Finding Nemo,Marlin,100,nemo!
102,Finding Nemo,Marlin,101,"no, no, no, no. he's my son. he was taken by these divers."
103,Finding Nemo,Marlin,102,ugh! what do these markings mean?
104,Finding Nemo,Marlin,103,i can't read human.
105,Finding Nemo,Marlin,104,"no, no, no, dory!"
106,Finding Nemo,Marlin,105,"no, dory!"
107,Finding Nemo,Marlin,106,"oh, i'm sorry. are you okay?"
108,Finding Nemo,Marlin,107,i'm so sorry.
109,Finding Nemo,Marlin,108,ohh...
110,Finding Nemo,Marlin,109,"dory, look out!"
111,Finding Nemo,Marlin,110,/dory aaaaaaaah!
112,Finding Nemo,Marlin,111,there's no way out! there's got to be a way to escape!
113,Finding Nemo,Marlin,112,"dory, help me find a way out!"
114,Finding Nemo,Marlin,113,there's gotta be a way out!
115,Finding Nemo,Marlin,114,let's go!
116,Finding Nemo,Marlin,115,
117,Finding Nemo,Marlin,116,"well, then here. read this now!"
118,Finding Nemo,Marlin,117,"oh no, it's blocked!"
119,Finding Nemo,Marlin,118,i need to get that mask!
120,Finding Nemo,Marlin,119,"no, no, no, no, no, no!"
121,Finding Nemo,Marlin,120,quick grab the mask!

128,Finding Nemo,Marlin,127,it's gone. i've lost the mask.
129,Finding Nemo,Marlin,128,"you dropped it! that was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone."
130,Finding Nemo,Marlin,129,i don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down.
131,Finding Nemo,Marlin,130,"dory, no singing."
132,Finding Nemo,Marlin,131,"see, i'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head!"
133,Finding Nemo,Marlin,132,"dory, do you see anything?"
134,Finding Nemo,Marlin,133,that was me. i'm sorry.
135,Finding Nemo,Marlin,134,who could it be? it's me!
136,Finding Nemo,Marlin,135,"yeah, yeah. i'm your conscience. we haven't spoken for a while. how are you?"
137,Finding Nemo,Marlin,136,"yeah? good. now, dory. i want you to tell me..do you see anything?"
138,Finding Nemo,Marlin,137,a light.
139,Finding Nemo,Marlin,138,"no, i see it too. what is it?"
140,Finding Nemo,Marlin,139,i'm feeling...happy. which is a big deal for me.
141,Finding Nemo,Marlin,140,"hey, come back. come on back here."
142,Finding Nemo,Marlin,141,i'm gonna get you. i'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone.
143,Finding Nemo,Marlin,142,i can't see! i don't know where i'm going!

162,Finding Nemo,Marlin,161,"y'know, i just, i-i think it's best if i just, if i just, carry on from here by..by myself."
163,Finding Nemo,Marlin,162,"y'know, alone."
164,Finding Nemo,Marlin,163,"without, without..well, i mean, not without you. i mean, it's just that i don't want you... with me."
165,Finding Nemo,Marlin,164,i don't wanna hurt your feelings..
166,Finding Nemo,Marlin,165,"well, i mean not..yes, yeah. it's just that you know i-i just can't afford anymore delays and you're one of those fish that cause delays. and sometimes it's a good thing. there's a whole group of fish. they're..'delay fish'."
167,Finding Nemo,Marlin,166,"no, of course i like you. it's because i like you i don't wanna be with you. it's a complicated emotion. oh, don't cry. i like you."
168,Finding Nemo,Marlin,167,"no, no, no, no, no. we're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how i can get to--"
169,Finding Nemo,Marlin,168,it's a swordfish.

173,Finding Nemo,Marlin,172,i'm serious.
174,Finding Nemo,Marlin,173,thank you.
175,Finding Nemo,Marlin,174,"what's the matter? while they're doing their silly little impressions, i am miles from home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name."
176,Finding Nemo,Marlin,175,yeah. meanwhile my son is out there.
177,Finding Nemo,Marlin,176,nemo.
178,Finding Nemo,Marlin,177,"but it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me."
179,Finding Nemo,Marlin,178,[gasps]
180,Finding Nemo,Marlin,179,"great! that's great! dory, you did it!"
181,Finding Nemo,Marlin,180,"well, listen fellas, thank you."

244,Finding Nemo,Marlin,243,"and my son,   nemo, see he was mad at me. and maybe he wouldn't have done it if i hadn't been so tough on   him, i don't know. anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out   there, these divers appeared and i tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. so we swam   out in the ocean to follow them..."
245,Finding Nemo,Marlin,244,where!? i don't see it!
246,Finding Nemo,Marlin,245,you mean the swirling vortex of terror!?

262,Finding Nemo,Marlin,261,"w-w-wait, i have definitely seen this floating speck before. that means we've passed it before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight!"
263,Finding Nemo,Marlin,262,"we gotta get to the surface, come on! let's figure it out up there. let's go! follow me! wha--?"
264,Finding Nemo,Marlin,263,"oh, fine. who do you wanna ask, the speck? there's nobody here!"
265,Finding Nemo,Marlin,264,"dory! dory! dory! okay, now it's my turn. i'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. it's a fish we don't know. and if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out our bones!"
266,Finding Nemo,Marlin,265,"look, i don't wanna play the gender card right now. you wanna play a card? let's play the 'let's not die' card."
267,Finding Nemo,Marlin,266,"of course, i do."

549,Twilight,Bella,316,"edward... why did you save me? (off his questioning look) if you'd let the venom spread,  i could've been like you by now."
550,Twilight,Bella,317,i want you. always.
551,Twilight,Bella,318,"i'm dying anyway. every minute,  i get closer, older"
552,Twilight,Bella,319,not the way alice saw it.  (off his sharp look) i heard her. she saw me like you.
553,Twilight,Bella,320,based on what someone decides. and  i've decided.
554,Twilight,Bella,321,i dream about being with you forever.
555,Twilight,Bella,322,yes.
556,Twilight,Bella,323,yes.

1164,Twilight,Edward,15,
1165,Twilight,Edward,16,i think i can keep up.
1166,Twilight,Edward,17,very complex. so you don't like him.
1167,Twilight,Edward,18,
1168,Twilight,Edward,19,but now you're unhappy.
1169,Twilight,Edward,20,
1170,Twilight,Edward,21,... no.

1173,Twilight,Edward,24,i was standing right next to you.
1174,Twilight,Edward,25,
1175,Twilight,Edward,26,you're confused. you hit your head.
1176,Twilight,Edward,27,"and what, exactly, was that?"
1177,Twilight,Edward,28,no one will believe that.
1178,Twilight,Edward,29,can't you just thank me and get  over it?
1179,Twilight,Edward,30,"you're not going to let it go, are you?"
1180,Twilight,Edward,31,"(turns, walks away) then i hope you enjoy disappointment."
1181,Twilight,Edward,32,... i don't know.
1182,Twilight,Edward,33,"... bella reaches for him, but he abruptly springs  backward, just out of reach."
1183,Twilight,Edward,34,what's in jacksonville?
1184,Twilight,Edward,35,you didn't answer my question.
1185,Twilight,Edward,36,hello.
1186,Twilight,Edward,37,adrenaline rush. very common.  google it.
1187,Twilight,Edward,38,it helps if you actually watch where you put your feet.
1188,Twilight,Edward,39,"i know i've been rude, but it's for  the best."
1189,Twilight,Edward,40,"bella, it would be better if we  weren't friends."
1190,Twilight,Edward,41,"(snapping, angry) you think i regret saving you?"
1191,Twilight,Edward,42,(furious) you don't know anything.
1192,Twilight,Edward,43,no. our bus is full.
1193,Twilight,Edward,44,(charmed) edible art.. .
1194,Twilight,Edward,45,"i said it would be better if we weren't  friends, not that i didn't want to be."
1195,Twilight,Edward,46,"it means if you were smart, you'd  avoid me."
1196,Twilight,Edward,47,probably not. i'd rather hear your  theories.
1197,Twilight,Edward,48,"(levels his gaze,"

1199,Twilight,Edward,50,it's just a little crowded.
1200,Twilight,Edward,51,get in.
1201,Twilight,Edward,52,(through gritted teeth) i should go back and rip their heads off.
1202,Twilight,Edward,53,"you don't know the vile, repulsive  things they were thinking."
1203,Twilight,Edward,54,(covering) not hard to guess.
1204,Twilight,Edward,55,sorry i kept bella from dinner. we  ran into each other and got talking.
1205,Twilight,Edward,56,
1206,Twilight,Edward,57,i'm on a special diet.

1212,Twilight,Edward,63,i feel very protective of you.
1213,Twilight,Edward,64,"yes, i followed you. i tried to  keep my distance...until you needed  help."
1214,Twilight,Edward,65,
1215,Twilight,Edward,66,"i have no idea. i can read every  mind in there, except yours."
1216,Twilight,Edward,67,i tell you i read minds and you think  there's something wrong with you?
1217,Twilight,Edward,68,i... don't have the strength to  stay away from you anymore.
1218,Twilight,Edward,69,(almost to himself) this is wrong.
1219,Twilight,Edward,70,you're cold. we should go.
1220,Twilight,Edward,71,that's my father's car. what's he --  ?
1221,Twilight,Edward,72,carlisle. what happened?
1222,Twilight,Edward,73,waylon lived all the way down on  queets river. 75 miles south.
1223,Twilight,Edward,74,seventeen.
1224,Twilight,Edward,75,... a while.
1225,Twilight,Edward,76,say it. out loud. say it.
1226,Twilight,Edward,77,are you afraid?
1227,Twilight,Edward,78,
1228,Twilight,Edward,79,you think you know me?
1229,Twilight,Edward,80,up the mountain. out of the cloud  bank. you need to see what  i  really am. what i look like in the  harsh light of the sun.
1230,Twilight,Edward,81,myth. you need to see the truth.
1231,Twilight,Edward,82,are you afraid?
1232,Twilight,Edward,83,then come with me. someplace where  no one can protect you. where  i  could do what i've wanted to do from  the first moment i met you.
1233,Twilight,Edward,84,
1234,Twilight,Edward,85,hold on.
1235,Twilight,Edward,86,are you afraid! ?
1236,Twilight,Edward,87,", his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some  trees. he watches her cautiously. she takes a step toward  him, but he holds up a hand. she waits. finally, he takes  a  deep breath, and steps out of the shade  -"
1237,Twilight,Edward,88,
1238,Twilight,Edward,89,this is what i am.
1239,Twilight,Edward,90,
1240,Twilight,Edward,91,"because you believe the lie. the  camouflage. i'm the world's most  dangerous predator. everything  about me invites you in - my voice,  my face, even my smell. as if  i  need any of that.. ."
1241,Twilight,Edward,92,as if you could outrun me. as if  you could fight me off.
1242,Twilight,Edward,93,i'm designed to kill.
1243,Twilight,Edward,94,i've killed people.
1244,Twilight,Edward,95,i wanted to kill you. i've never wanted a human's blood so much in  my life. i'm dangerous to you.
1245,Twilight,Edward,96,don't.
1246,Twilight,Edward,97,you... took me by surprise.  (collecting himself) i don't know how to... do this.
1247,Twilight,Edward,98,"me, and my family, we're different  from others of our kind. we're not  nomadic, we have a permanent home.  we only hunt animals. we've  learned to control our thirst.. ."
1248,Twilight,Edward,99,i did. for making me want you so badly.  i'm still not sure i can control myself.
1249,Twilight,Edward,100,i wish i could understand this  thing you see in me. you look at  me with those eyes.. .
1250,Twilight,Edward,101,(devastated) good.
1251,Twilight,Edward,102,

1255,Twilight,Edward,106,since nineteen-eighteen. that's  when carlisle found me.
1256,Twilight,Edward,107,"in a hospital, dying of spanish  influenza. my parents had already died."
1257,Twilight,Edward,108,(v.o. ) the word excruciating comes to  mind. but what carlisle did was  much harder... not many of us have  the restraint to do that.
1258,Twilight,Edward,109,"not just. our bite contains venom.  and once we taste blood, a sort of.. .  frenzy begins. it's almost  impossible to stop."
1259,Twilight,Edward,110,"first with me, then with his wife,  esme. he found her in a hospital,  as well. the others followed."
1260,Twilight,Edward,111,"... no, that's just carlisle. he  would never do... this, to someone  who had another choice."
1261,Twilight,Edward,112,not the only reason.
1262,Twilight,Edward,113,i don't want to be a monster.
1263,Twilight,Edward,114,"we call ourselves vegetarians, by  the way... for our kind, hunting  animals is like living on tofu. it  keeps you strong but isn't very  satisfying."
1264,Twilight,Edward,115,"it's not that impressive, really.  anyone in my family can do this."
1265,Twilight,Edward,116,"no, that's unique to me. but alice can  see the future."
1266,Twilight,Edward,117,her visions are very subjective.  the future can change.
1267,Twilight,Edward,118,come to my house tomorrow.
1268,Twilight,Edward,119,

1277,Twilight,Edward,128,a private joke. we matriculate a lot.
1278,Twilight,Edward,129,"true, but the younger we start out in  a  new place, the longer we can stay there."
1279,Twilight,Edward,130,... and this is my room.
1280,Twilight,Edward,131,no sleep.
1281,Twilight,Edward,132,"no nightmares, no drool, no  snoring."

1287,Twilight,Edward,138,you really shouldn't have said that.
1288,Twilight,Edward,139,trust me?

1291,Twilight,Edward,142,the window. as always.
1292,Twilight,Edward,143,what else is there to do at night?

1301,Twilight,Edward,152,"(looks him in the eyes) she'll be safe with me, sir, i promise."
1302,Twilight,Edward,153,
1303,Twilight,Edward,154,"it's the american pastime. plus,  there's a thunderstorm coming. it's the  only time we can play. you'll see why."
1304,Twilight,Edward,155,(to bella) put your hair down  -
1305,Twilight,Edward,156,i shouldn't have brought you here.  i'm so sorry.
1306,Twilight,Edward,157,"springs in front of bella, baring his teeth. a truly  menacing, feral snarl rips from his throat. james growls back."
1307,Twilight,Edward,158,"james is a tracker. i saw his mind.  the hunt is his obsession, and my  reaction set him off - -"
1308,Twilight,Edward,159,-- we're a large clan of strong fighters  all protecting one vulnerable human.
1309,Twilight,Edward,160,the first place he'll go is your  house. he'll track your scent  there.

1311,Twilight,Edward,162,"bella, don't do this. just think  about it, please  -"
1312,Twilight,Edward,163,(whispering) i'll be in the truck.
1313,Twilight,Edward,164,he'll forgive you. (off bella's startled look) slide over.. .
1314,Twilight,Edward,165,it was the only way he'd let you go.
1315,Twilight,Edward,166,"your father's safe now, bella. the  tracker is following us  -"
1316,Twilight,Edward,167,it's alright. it's just emmett.  alice is in the car behind us.
1317,Twilight,Edward,168,but not impossible. we'll tear him up
1318,Twilight,Edward,169,"i'll run bella south, while you lead  the tracker away  -"
1319,Twilight,Edward,170,"(studies her, torn) can you keep your thoughts to yourself?"
1320,Twilight,Edward,171,"esme, rosalie, put these on so the  tracker will pick up bella's scent."
1321,Twilight,Edward,172,"we won't, there are five of us, two of  them. when it's done, i'll come get you."

1326,Twilight,Edward,177,i'm strong enough to kill you.
1327,Twilight,Edward,178,venom - -
1328,Twilight,Edward,179,no!
1329,Twilight,Edward,180,it doesn't have to be that way.

1332,Twilight,Edward,183,i -- won't be able to stop  -
1333,Twilight,Edward,184,"it's alright, bella. i'll make it  go away."
1334,Twilight,Edward,185,"we took care of him. and the  woman, victoria, she ran off."
1335,Twilight,Edward,186,(darkens) you're in here because of me.
1336,Twilight,Edward,187,the worst of it... was thinking  i  couldn't stop -
1337,Twilight,Edward,188,"bella, you should go to jacksonville.  where i can't hurt you anymore.. ."

1344,Twilight,Edward,195,(angry) i won't end your life for you.
1345,Twilight,Edward,196,that's how it's supposed to happen.
1346,Twilight,Edward,197,"her visions change, bella."
1347,Twilight,Edward,198,is that what you dream about?  becoming a monster?
1348,Twilight,Edward,199,you really want this?
1349,Twilight,Edward,200,you're ready right now?
1350,Twilight,Edward,201,you're going to have a long and  happy life with me. isn't that  enough?
788,Megamind,Master Mind,0,"the real einstein once said, ""god does not play dice with the world."" he was right, because the world is my dice. is that understood?"
789,Megamind,Master Mind,1,"alright, then - clean slate. do we have the girl?"
790,Megamind,Master Mind,2,"reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated."
791,Megamind,Master Mind,3,"alright, let's not keep the lady waiting."
792,Megamind,Master Mind,4,"(o.s.) miss ritchi, we meet again."
793,Megamind,Master Mind,5,"i trust you gentlemen know the very sassy roxanne ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe uberman. and miss ritchi, i trust you've already met my new crew: the mad geniuses!"
794,Megamind,Master Mind,6,"in a way, i already have."
795,Megamind,Master Mind,7,what about my revenge?
796,Megamind,Master Mind,8,you have a wicked tongue. i hope you rid yourself of that when you're my queen.
797,Megamind,Master Mind,9,"power corrupts absolutely, miss ritchi. and when i have ultimate power over this city, i have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it."
798,Megamind,Master Mind,10,(annoyed) what is it!?
799,Megamind,Master Mind,11,"(o.s.) over here, old friend."
800,Megamind,Master Mind,12,"(on monitor) actually, i wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend."
801,Megamind,Master Mind,13,"(on monitor) oh, can't i? i have attained control of the earth's most abundant energy source. i doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the full concentrated power of the sun!!!"
802,Megamind,Master Mind,14,"excellent. stop here, i like this view."
803,Megamind,Master Mind,15,any last words?
804,Megamind,Master Mind,16,(genuinely concerned) what's going on?
805,Megamind,Master Mind,17,what kind of trick is this?
806,Megamind,Master Mind,18,"yeah, so?"
807,Megamind,Master Mind,19,your weakness is copper?
808,Megamind,Master Mind,20,(carefully skeptical) well...let's not get ahead of ourselves.
809,Megamind,Master Mind,21,i knew it! prepare yourselves! he's gonna ram us!!!
810,Megamind,Master Mind,22,(cont'd) (horrified) holy shit! 11.
811,Megamind,Master Mind,23,...so i did.
812,Megamind,Master Mind,24,"(absentmindedly) oh, right."
813,Megamind,Master Mind,25,"(feigning pleasure) great, great. put it on the pile."
814,Megamind,Master Mind,26,no.
815,Megamind,Master Mind,27,maybe later.
816,Megamind,Master Mind,28,"(cont'd) what is it, plato?"
817,Megamind,Master Mind,29,when i want your opinion i'll beat it out of you.
818,Megamind,Master Mind,30,i have defeated my greatest enemy. i have free reign over metro city. i have more wealth than a thousand sultans. i've achieved all i have worked for...so why am i so unhappy?
819,Megamind,Master Mind,31,"i mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil. (more) 23. master mind(cont'd) and, i have accomplished something he had only dreamed about - the destruction of metro city's champion. i tell you, i've always lived with this unquenchable thirst. i thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power. but now that i've pretty much accomplished both, i am at a loss."
820,Megamind,Master Mind,32,"(snippy) oh, really?"
821,Megamind,Master Mind,33,"he was a worthy rival. sometimes i wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was i just an annoying, little gnat to him? ...what's the second part?"
822,Megamind,Master Mind,34,you worm! how dare you! where would you get such a notion?
823,Megamind,Master Mind,35,who the hell is john cusack?
824,Megamind,Master Mind,36,"john cusack, huh? so all i have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and - oh, remove both my balls."
825,Megamind,Master Mind,37,"please, get a hold of yourself."
826,Megamind,Master Mind,38,i've got it! 32.
827,Megamind,Master Mind,39,i've got it!
828,Megamind,Master Mind,40,"it's plain and simple. extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. without that stimulus they wither and die. therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: i must create a new superhero."
829,Megamind,Master Mind,41,(ignoring him) prepare for operation superhero genesis!
830,Megamind,Master Mind,42,prepare the subject.
831,Megamind,Master Mind,43,"(cont'd) plato, pour the toxic waste."
832,Megamind,Master Mind,44,(cont'd) drainage.
833,Megamind,Master Mind,45,"(cont'd) well, severs?"
834,Megamind,Master Mind,46,okay then.
835,Megamind,Master Mind,47,and this one?
836,Megamind,Master Mind,48,ah. does he have extraordinary strength?
837,Megamind,Master Mind,49,can he fly?
838,Megamind,Master Mind,50,resilient to weapons fire?
839,Megamind,Master Mind,51,"he just breathes under water, then."
840,Megamind,Master Mind,52,"plato, the radioactive spider, please."
841,Megamind,Master Mind,53,"anything, stenwick?"
842,Megamind,Master Mind,54,we're gonna need more venom.
843,Megamind,Master Mind,55,"(cont'd) how `bout now, stenwick? ....stenwick?"
844,Megamind,Master Mind,56,this has proven to be a challenge. i just don't know what i want. what do i want? 35.
845,Megamind,Master Mind,57,"(cont'd) i want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong. someone who doesn't seek power - instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion."
846,Megamind,Master Mind,58,that's it! why make a copy when the real thing will do?
847,Megamind,Master Mind,59,"then we'll make a new one. plato, bring me the box!"
848,Megamind,Master Mind,60,behold - uberessence. the very thing that gave uberman his superhuman powers. 36.
849,Megamind,Master Mind,61,"oh, i shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil ubermen. i'm not sure why i never got around to following up with that."
850,Megamind,Master Mind,62,"...right. man, he was good!"
851,Megamind,Master Mind,63,"not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. somebody else, somebody pure."
852,Megamind,Master Mind,64,(cont'd) somebody like him!
853,Megamind,Master Mind,65,(into phone) a modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. i love it.
854,Megamind,Master Mind,66,he volunteers. he doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds. the fates are shining down on me. this mr. stewart is truly an unselfish soul.
855,Megamind,Master Mind,67,(o.s.) (over radio) then return to base. we have much work to do.
856,Megamind,Master Mind,68,"now, we're sure this won't kill him?"
857,Megamind,Master Mind,69,good.
858,Megamind,Master Mind,70,slight electrical shock?
859,Megamind,Master Mind,71,follow him.
860,Megamind,Master Mind,72,"welcome to your second birth, hal stewart."
861,Megamind,Master Mind,73,"(cont'd) instruction is very important in the formative years. every hero needs a mentor, a father figure to look up to."
862,Megamind,Master Mind,74,"(reading paper) oh, for heaven's sake. i can't believe it. he misspelled his name."
863,Megamind,Master Mind,75,"(cont'd) no matter, i suppose."
864,Megamind,Master Mind,76,(cont'd) we've now fully established titan as metro city's hero. they will love him just as they loved uberman. everything is going according to plan.
865,Megamind,Master Mind,77,"you know, einstein, maybe i should have called you socrates. he also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself."
866,Megamind,Master Mind,78,to what?
867,Megamind,Master Mind,79,"the reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. we take over the earth, like you said. then what? women? cars? money? even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over."
868,Megamind,Master Mind,80,you dare?
869,Megamind,Master Mind,81,what - did - you - call me?
870,Megamind,Master Mind,82,"that is none of your business, knave!"
871,Megamind,Master Mind,83,silence!
872,Megamind,Master Mind,84,"i'm warning you, einstein."
873,Megamind,Master Mind,85,i said silence!
874,Megamind,Master Mind,86,(cont'd) get out of my sight. 62.
875,Megamind,Master Mind,87,"(cont'd) oh, no. don't look at me."
876,Megamind,Master Mind,88,"you're not gonna get all freaky about this, are you?"
877,Megamind,Master Mind,89,"i only did this because i wanted to talk to you on the same level. you know, without all the baggage?"
878,Megamind,Master Mind,90,"you see, that's exactly what i'm talking about."
879,Megamind,Master Mind,91,(cont'd) roxanne!
880,Megamind,Master Mind,92,what?
881,Megamind,Master Mind,93,"(mumbling to himself) stupid. what was i thinking? plato, it's his fault. he's the one who sent me on this weak-willed path. i'll filet his scrotum for this. me, a creature of evil, in love with roxanne ritchi. preposterous. i hardly give such matters thought"
882,Megamind,Master Mind,94,"i should just go up there and just lay it all out to her. ""roxanne, i like you - i always have. oh, and i'm sorry i blew up your ex. (realizing the absurdity of his words) yeah, that would go over like a pants-less clown at a child's birthday party. what the hell am i even doing here? who cares what she thinks? i'm a supervillain and here i am acting like a love struck schoolboy. forget this. i control my own destiny! 66."
883,Megamind,Master Mind,95,(cont'd) (disgusted) perfect.
884,Megamind,Master Mind,96,"hello, triple a? 67."
885,Megamind,Master Mind,97,i'll call you back.
886,Megamind,Master Mind,98,(o.s.) the lady said no.
887,Megamind,Master Mind,99,"no, it's a goo gun."
888,Megamind,Master Mind,100,it goos.
889,Megamind,Master Mind,101,(cont'd) it's...a prototype.
890,Megamind,Master Mind,102,don't - ever - say that again.
891,Megamind,Master Mind,103,don't flatter yourself.
892,Megamind,Master Mind,104,"my, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves."
893,Megamind,Master Mind,105,no.
894,Megamind,Master Mind,106,"(overly calm) fine, why do you ask?"
895,Megamind,Master Mind,107,go on.
896,Megamind,Master Mind,108,"just with business, my minion. just with business. i've decided it is time."
897,Megamind,Master Mind,109,"yes, we've created our hero, now it's time to give him a little motivation."
898,Megamind,Master Mind,110,to be simply good is not enough. a hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected.
899,Megamind,Master Mind,111,"yes, he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure. gentlemen, it's time for operation mentor kill!"
900,Megamind,Master Mind,112,"alright, people, we don't have much time. titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out."
901,Megamind,Master Mind,113,(cont'd) how's the death ray coming?
902,Megamind,Master Mind,114,"hum. let's turn it down a few notches. it's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we?"
903,Megamind,Master Mind,115,(cont'd) anything on the radar yet?
904,Megamind,Master Mind,116,"i see. well, he must be planning something big. are the flame androids deployed?"
905,Megamind,Master Mind,117,"wonderful, wonderful. plato, da vinci, take your places next to me."
906,Megamind,Master Mind,118,(cont'd) no slouching.
907,Megamind,Master Mind,119,he'll be here. that's the way it works.
908,Megamind,Master Mind,120,"(cont'd) unprofessional, that's what this is. no, it's disrespect for the craft."
909,Megamind,Master Mind,121,(cont'd) would uberman have kept us waiting like this? of course not. he was a pro who knew the score. it's time we spelled out a few things for this titan. i will not be made a fool of.
910,Megamind,Master Mind,122,do you know who i am? 75.
911,Megamind,Master Mind,123,"oh, so now you want to get down to it. well, i want to get a few things off my chest first."
912,Megamind,Master Mind,124,(cont'd) of all the inconsiderate - do you have any idea how long we waited for you? we're you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge?
913,Megamind,Master Mind,125,"(interrupting) -you got to thinking? there's nothing to think about. i'm the villain. i do something bad, you come and get me."
914,Megamind,Master Mind,126,maybe you're right. what's the point?
915,Megamind,Master Mind,127,(cont'd) what are these?
916,Megamind,Master Mind,128,(baffled) where did you get all this?
917,Megamind,Master Mind,129,from where?
918,Megamind,Master Mind,130,"well, what about your mentor?"
919,Megamind,Master Mind,131,you want to team-up? 77.
920,Megamind,Master Mind,132,what do i think?
921,Megamind,Master Mind,133,"(cont'd) i think you're probably the biggest idiot i've ever met. i mean, i can't believe you. all your gifts, all your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment. you know what? your kind of people make me sick."
922,Megamind,Master Mind,134,oh - gee - i am so sorry! 78.
923,Megamind,Master Mind,135,"(cont'd) (under his breath) of all the people to pick, it had to be this loser."
924,Megamind,Master Mind,136,"i wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache."
925,Megamind,Master Mind,137,"oh, yeah? what are you gonna do?"
926,Megamind,Master Mind,138,(o.s.) it hurts.
927,Megamind,Master Mind,139,it!
928,Megamind,Master Mind,140,"i just made myself redundant, old friend."
929,Megamind,Master Mind,141,"well, there's no use crying about it now, we must take action. i'm not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon. we must destroy tighten. 82."
930,Megamind,Master Mind,142,"yes, but he possesses the same flaws present in uberman's dna - copper. it's like benjamin franklin always said: ""if something works don't dick with it."""
931,Megamind,Master Mind,143,"(o.s.) your time has come to an end, titan!"
932,Megamind,Master Mind,144,there can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's me.
933,Megamind,Master Mind,145,i have a better idea - now!
934,Megamind,Master Mind,146,(cont'd) that's copper my good man. your one weakness. (more) 84. master mind(cont'd) for all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect.
935,Megamind,Master Mind,147,he's not as dumb as i thought.
936,Megamind,Master Mind,148,what's funny?
937,Megamind,Master Mind,149,"wow, i always thought uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little roxanne dated a linebacker in college."
938,Megamind,Master Mind,150,so it is. 86.
939,Megamind,Master Mind,151,"well, then i wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find."
940,Megamind,Master Mind,152,i need your help.
941,Megamind,Master Mind,153,you're not going to like what i'm about to tell you.
942,Megamind,Master Mind,154,tell me about it.
943,Megamind,Master Mind,155,"well, the evil thing he did by himself. my goal was to give myself purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner."
944,Megamind,Master Mind,156,and they call me master mind.
945,Megamind,Master Mind,157,in hindsight...
946,Megamind,Master Mind,158,(almost ashamed) i had some left over from something. i infused him with it.
947,Megamind,Master Mind,159,"yeah, that's why i decided to tie you up."
948,Megamind,Master Mind,160,he seemed nice. 88.
949,Megamind,Master Mind,161,"yeah, good to know - now!"
950,Megamind,Master Mind,162,it's a modest profession!
951,Megamind,Master Mind,163,my lair is in the direct path of the ball.
952,Megamind,Master Mind,164,you don't understand. i have certain equipment that's - that's highly unstable.
953,Megamind,Master Mind,165,"i sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay?"
954,Megamind,Master Mind,166,"it's experimental - only one in the world...well, how do you think i power all my inventions? someone like me can't pay for electricity. the bills would be outrageous."
955,Megamind,Master Mind,167,it creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one...if destroyed it could...
956,Megamind,Master Mind,168,"(proudly) pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard, actually. that little baby is amazing. i'm quite proud of it. (more) 91. master mind(cont'd) (off her deadpan reaction) i mean...we'd better find a way to stop him."
957,Megamind,Master Mind,169,did uberman have a hideout?
958,Megamind,Master Mind,170,"a cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. c'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance."
959,Megamind,Master Mind,171,whose house?
960,Megamind,Master Mind,172,"wayne scott? uberman was wayne scott!? wayne scott, the wealthy philanthropist? but he disappeared -"
961,Megamind,Master Mind,173,"""metro city doomed."" you know, i never thought i'd say something like this, but here it goes -"
962,Megamind,Master Mind,174,(cont'd) not if i have anything to say about it.
963,Megamind,Master Mind,175,"such a dark place for one such as you. i wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice?"
964,Megamind,Master Mind,176,"good lord, man. you've only been dead for two months."
965,Megamind,Master Mind,177,"(cont'd) a disguise so simple, it's ingenious. no wonder i never caught on."
966,Megamind,Master Mind,178,"(cont'd) two lives, yet in both you were an ideal. perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end, old friend."
967,Megamind,Master Mind,179,(cont'd) i'll miss how predictable you were.
968,Megamind,Master Mind,180,(cont'd) hello? anyone here...besides..all the big men who are with me now?
969,Megamind,Master Mind,181,"(cont'd) (to himself) what's the worst you're gonna find? (more) 94. master mind(cont'd) the man was a boy scout, not a serial killer."
970,Megamind,Master Mind,182,ahhhhhh!
971,Megamind,Master Mind,183,i might just ask you the same question. i had thought i incinerated you.
972,Megamind,Master Mind,184,"roxanne told me. as for your ruse, i forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - somebody pointed that out to me recently. figured if they could do it, so could you. but one thing i couldn't figure out -"
973,Megamind,Master Mind,185,a few months? how long had you been planning this?
974,Megamind,Master Mind,186,i see it all so clearly now.
975,Megamind,Master Mind,187,(cont'd - v.o.) you must have done it just seconds before the observatory exploded. 96.
976,Megamind,Master Mind,188,"(cont'd - v.o.) you bore out from under the cage. then, using your uber-speed, -"
977,Megamind,Master Mind,189,"(cont'd - v.o.) - you made your way to safety, where you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere."
978,Megamind,Master Mind,190,"(cont'd - v.o) (cont'd) then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion, then..."
979,Megamind,Master Mind,191,but why fake your death? why go through all of it? you could have just quit.
980,Megamind,Master Mind,192,and wayne scott? why did he have to disappear?
981,Megamind,Master Mind,193,i just can't believe it. this whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart?
982,Megamind,Master Mind,194,"there's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - i mean, your city."
983,Megamind,Master Mind,195,you're really going to do nothing?
984,Megamind,Master Mind,196,you're the only one who can stop him.
985,Megamind,Master Mind,197,a plane?
986,Megamind,Master Mind,198,not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap.
987,Megamind,Master Mind,199,i got lucky.
988,Megamind,Master Mind,200,(suddenly confused) what do you mean?
989,Megamind,Master Mind,201,"game? - was that all this ever was to you? you know, i was trying my best every time i fought you. those `outs' as you call them were unintentional."
990,Megamind,Master Mind,202,"i guess i was never really a match for you, was i?"
991,Megamind,Master Mind,203,(cont'd) (thoughtfully) then how can i expect to be one for titan?
992,Megamind,Master Mind,204,(cont'd) what about roxanne?
993,Megamind,Master Mind,205,"i guess i wasn't the villain i thought i was, and you...you weren't the hero i thought you were."
994,Megamind,Master Mind,206,"hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible."
995,Megamind,Master Mind,207,"i told you, titan is too powerful. if he's set on destroying us, there's precious little we could do about it."
996,Megamind,Master Mind,208,"to another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight. we'll start over, we'll go back to doing what we do best."
997,Megamind,Master Mind,209,"plato, do you have a better plan?!"
998,Megamind,Master Mind,210,(cont'd) hello...roxanne?
999,Megamind,Master Mind,211,"right now i'm packing, later i'll have a snack on the train."
1000,Megamind,Master Mind,212,in a word - yes.
1001,Megamind,Master Mind,213,i didn't create this - the god's of irony did and i am eating the crow i so richly deserve.
1002,Megamind,Master Mind,214,i'll make the time.
1003,Megamind,Master Mind,215,(cont'd) you can leave with us. you'll be safe.
1004,Megamind,Master Mind,216,"will you listen to me, no one can stop him."
1005,Megamind,Master Mind,217,i'm afraid you have an inflated opinion of me.
1006,Megamind,Master Mind,218,what?
1007,Megamind,Master Mind,219,"sweet words, but that man is dead. please, roxanne, just come with me."
1008,Megamind,Master Mind,220,roxanne? roxanne?
1009,Megamind,Master Mind,221,"dad, it's me... (he looks around to make sure no one can hear) ...bubsy. i know we haven't talked in a while, and i'm sorry. it's been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy."
1010,Megamind,Master Mind,222,"anyway...you raised me to be the worst that i could possibly be. and i've tried to live up to that as best as i could - even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. but i'm about to do something now that would really piss you off. i'm going to go against everything you ever taught me. i hope...i hope that maybe you'll look down at what i'm about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. if you could do that, then maybe - in your own little way - you could - for probably the first time - find a reason to be proud of me."
1011,Megamind,Master Mind,223,"well...either way, you're probably going to see me real soon. (calling over his shoulder) men?"
1012,Megamind,Master Mind,224,stop packing. our work is not finished here.
1013,Megamind,Master Mind,225,"c'mon, slow down"
1014,Megamind,Master Mind,226,c'mon.
1015,Megamind,Master Mind,227,gutterball!
1016,Megamind,Master Mind,228,bowling? what other trailer park sports can you play? 112.
1017,Megamind,Master Mind,229,
1018,Megamind,Master Mind,230,shit! stupid monkeys and their fruit.
1019,Megamind,Master Mind,231,could it really be that easy--
1020,Megamind,Master Mind,232,(cont'd) didn't think so.
1021,Megamind,Master Mind,233,i'm alive.
1022,Megamind,Master Mind,234,uberman? 114.
1023,Megamind,Master Mind,235,i thought.
1024,Megamind,Master Mind,236,for what?
1025,Megamind,Master Mind,237,wait!!!
1026,Megamind,Master Mind,238,quick joke - what's the capital of thailand?
1027,Megamind,Master Mind,239,it's bang cock!
1028,Megamind,Master Mind,240,"so, i guess pennies are good for something. 116."
1029,Megamind,Master Mind,241,they're cheering for me.
1030,Megamind,Master Mind,242,"it's a...it's nice, you know? i usually don't get a lot of feedback. (whispering) but i also kind of caused all this. what happens when they find that out i was the cause of some of this?"
1031,Megamind,Master Mind,243,i guess that is all in the past.
1032,Megamind,Master Mind,244,i don't think i'd go that far...i mean i just...er...
1033,Megamind,Master Mind,245,yes?
1034,Megamind,Master Mind,246,sorry - metal hand. force of habit.
1035,Megamind,Master Mind,247,"(cont'd) we're okay, right?"
1036,Megamind,Master Mind,248,(o.s) i don't think it would go with your outfit.
1037,Megamind,Master Mind,249,i'm gonna give you a chance to surrender.
1038,Megamind,Master Mind,250,"way to take out those two goons, guys!"
1039,Megamind,Master Mind,251,"(apologetically) sorry, we're new at this."
1099,Megamind,Roxanne,0,you didn't need to turn around like that. i can recognize the stench of failure.
1100,Megamind,Roxanne,1,"looks like a real group of winners. at the risk of sounding cliche', you'll never get away with this."
1101,Megamind,Roxanne,2,"we go through this every time. you kidnap me to get to uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes whatever lame trap you've come up with, and takes you and your cronies to jail. i propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by you letting me go, and me forgetting this whole thing ever happened?"
1102,Megamind,Roxanne,3,we can say it was wasting everyone's time.
1103,Megamind,Roxanne,4,i'm sorry. what makes you think i would want to be your queen?
1104,Megamind,Roxanne,5,uberman!
1105,Megamind,Roxanne,6,uberman?
1106,Megamind,Roxanne,7,(cont'd) you killed him!
1107,Megamind,Roxanne,8,it's...um...it's good to be back. thanks for everyone's cards and concerns. i really appreciated it - now i'm ready to climb back on the horse.
1108,Megamind,Roxanne,9,it's okay.
1109,Megamind,Roxanne,10,aren't you?
1110,Megamind,Roxanne,11,"frank, listen. i want to go back to work. i need to go back to work."
1111,Megamind,Roxanne,12,what're you doing?
1112,Megamind,Roxanne,13,"it was a traumatic experience. yes, everyone knows uberman and me were...close. but what i really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work."
1113,Megamind,Roxanne,14,i thought you'd be happy to have me back. 19.
1114,Megamind,Roxanne,15,yes?
1115,Megamind,Roxanne,16,in three weeks?
1116,Megamind,Roxanne,17,(disgusted) brad? brad helms? the man is an idiot.
1117,Megamind,Roxanne,18,"oh, because they can't use me to get the big story."
1118,Megamind,Roxanne,19,(defensive) i didn't use him.
1119,Megamind,Roxanne,20,we were. 20.
1120,Megamind,Roxanne,21,very in love.
1121,Megamind,Roxanne,22,"okay. so, where are they going to move me if brad has my spot?"
1122,Megamind,Roxanne,23,bake sales and pet stories.
1123,Megamind,Roxanne,24,i'll take it.
1124,Megamind,Roxanne,25,i just wanted to get back to work.
1125,Megamind,Roxanne,26,i keep trying to tell people it wasn't really like that. uberman and i - we were kinda having problems. we broke up.
1126,Megamind,Roxanne,27,maybe someone who's a little more aware of his faults. someone a little more sensitive. 25.
1127,Megamind,Roxanne,28,"well, until he miraculously comes walking into my life, i'm just going to take a little reflection time for myself."
1128,Megamind,Roxanne,29,"councilman, is it true that your brother-in-law's construction company won the contract for this project?"
1129,Megamind,Roxanne,30,what's it feel like to be a hero?
1130,Megamind,Roxanne,31,shit.
1131,Megamind,Roxanne,32,(stunned) you're...you're.
1132,Megamind,Roxanne,33,"(captivated) ...yes. (catching herself) i mean, excuse me?"
1133,Megamind,Roxanne,34,right.
1134,Megamind,Roxanne,35,i did have a boyfriend - until fairly recently.
1135,Megamind,Roxanne,36,i'm sorry - this is so surreal!
1136,Megamind,Roxanne,37,things were complicated. he was a man married to his work. there was...there was a lot of competition in his line of business. i'm sure you know what that's like.
1137,Megamind,Roxanne,38,...the body-builder who used to play the hulk on tv?
1138,Megamind,Roxanne,39,well...one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than i ever did. but enough about my problems.
1139,Megamind,Roxanne,40,"right, well, he seemed to need him more than he needed me."
1140,Megamind,Roxanne,41,"it was conflict he thrived on. he always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if master - i mean, this guy were gone. it was like he needed it, like oxygen."
1141,Megamind,Roxanne,42,what?
1142,Megamind,Roxanne,43,i'd love that.

1144,Megamind,Roxanne,45,"(v.o.) hi, it's roxanne. listen, i...i really enjoyed talking with you the other day."
1145,Megamind,Roxanne,46,"(v.o.) great. god, i feel really silly, and if you have a lot going on i totally understand. but, i was wondering if you maybe wanted to have lunch."
1146,Megamind,Roxanne,47,"(v.o.) great. how does the park sound, around noon-ish?"
1147,Megamind,Roxanne,48,"(v.o.) great, see you then. 52."
1148,Megamind,Roxanne,49,how's your sandwich?
1149,Megamind,Roxanne,50,hope you don't think i'm too forward. some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out. i just find you really easy to talk to.
1150,Megamind,Roxanne,51,"you know, you're not at all like you are in the movies."
1151,Megamind,Roxanne,52,"yeah. i don't know - you have this strange, refined way of speaking."
1152,Megamind,Roxanne,53,"anyway, when we were talking the other day i just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that we've known each other for years."
1153,Megamind,Roxanne,54,you know what? this sandwich is disgusting.
1154,Megamind,Roxanne,55,(cont'd) of course i already ate half of it. i wonder what that says about my character?
1155,Megamind,Roxanne,56,"thanks, but knowing me, i was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. it might have been okay at first, but i just made it bitter."
1156,Megamind,Roxanne,57,"when i look back, i probably shouldn't of expected so much from him. he was already a giving person. you know, one of those go out and save the world types."
1157,Megamind,Roxanne,58,"i was selfish, i guess. i didn't want to share him with anybody else."
1158,Megamind,Roxanne,59,they broke the mold.
1159,Megamind,Roxanne,60,"listen, brad. we were just in the area. i was just trying to -"
1160,Megamind,Roxanne,61,"he's right. old habit, i guess. (to brad) we'll get out of your way."
1161,Megamind,Roxanne,62,"don't get me wrong, i love being a reporter. i don't think i could do anything else. it's the consequences of what we do that i'm having a problem with."
1162,Megamind,Roxanne,63,it's supposed to.
1163,Megamind,Roxanne,64,"i got someone i cared about killed. if it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been involved."
1164,Megamind,Roxanne,65,was he an actor?
1165,Megamind,Roxanne,66,jail? 63.
1166,Megamind,Roxanne,67,was he ever successful?
1167,Megamind,Roxanne,68,"thanks for this. you know, this is embarrassing, but it's been a long time since i -"
1168,Megamind,Roxanne,69,(cont'd) i think it's starting to rain. we might want to find a table inside.
1169,Megamind,Roxanne,70,"oh, i was gonna say...it's been a long time since...well, i've been with someone i...enjoy being with."
1170,Megamind,Roxanne,71,oh my god.
1171,Megamind,Roxanne,72,"this...this is too much, even for you. god, i go out with you, tell you my innermost thoughts."
1172,Megamind,Roxanne,73,"baggage? you burned my boyfriend alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!"
1173,Megamind,Roxanne,74,stay away from me.

1179,Megamind,Roxanne,80,hey!
1180,Megamind,Roxanne,81,(cont'd) are you following me or something? 69.
1181,Megamind,Roxanne,82,don't walk away from me when i'm talking to you.
1182,Megamind,Roxanne,83,"(cont'd) what a minute...all that stuff you use to say to me when uberman was alive - about me being the loyal queen by your side as you rule over metro city. that wasn't just super villain rhetoric, was it? you actually meant it!"
1183,Megamind,Roxanne,84,(coldly) do you really think i would be with someone like you?
1184,Megamind,Roxanne,85,that's my diary.
1185,Megamind,Roxanne,86,it's personal.
1186,Megamind,Roxanne,87,what do you want?
1187,Megamind,Roxanne,88,so you knock me out and tie me to a chair?
1188,Megamind,Roxanne,89,he's really out of control.
1189,Megamind,Roxanne,90,"i should have known. you have something to do with this, don't you? - with titan turning evil. 87."
1190,Megamind,Roxanne,91,(confused) you're talking like you made him.
1191,Megamind,Roxanne,92,"let me get this straight. you missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass. that's pathetic."
1192,Megamind,Roxanne,93,"and his powers, they're just like uberman's. why would he have his powers?"
1193,Megamind,Roxanne,94,you did what!?
1194,Megamind,Roxanne,95,you did all this because you wanted purpose?
1195,Megamind,Roxanne,96,hal stewart. he's the guy we thought saved that woman and kid. turned out he was just trying to save his own ass.
1196,Megamind,Roxanne,97,you picked a bowler to give super powers to?
1197,Megamind,Roxanne,98,"my god, he's nuts. that'll destroy the whole business triangle. 90."
1198,Megamind,Roxanne,99,what?
1199,Megamind,Roxanne,100,"oh, real nice. wouldn't want anything to happen to your hideout, would we?"
1200,Megamind,Roxanne,101,what do you mean?
1201,Megamind,Roxanne,102,a hydrogen reactor?
1202,Megamind,Roxanne,103,a reactor?
1203,Megamind,Roxanne,104,- vaporize the entire city!
1204,Megamind,Roxanne,105,what?
1205,Megamind,Roxanne,106,it's under his house.
1206,Megamind,Roxanne,107,wayne scott's.
1207,Megamind,Roxanne,108,"(interrupting) he disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him. not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous man."
1208,Megamind,Roxanne,109,(cont'd) looks like you got what you always wanted. uberman is out of the picture and metro city is doomed.
1209,Megamind,Roxanne,110,long enough.
1210,Megamind,Roxanne,111,(cont'd) don't you have something else you can go do?
1211,Megamind,Roxanne,112,what are you going to do about tighten?
1212,Megamind,Roxanne,113,you're running away?
1213,Megamind,Roxanne,114,you created this monster...
1214,Megamind,Roxanne,115,there's no time for self pity. 105.
1215,Megamind,Roxanne,116,i'm not going anywhere.
1216,Megamind,Roxanne,117,you have to try. the city needs your help.
1217,Megamind,Roxanne,118,what the hell's happened to you? the master mind i knew would never have run from a fight even though he knew deep in his heart that he didn't have a chance in hell of winning it. it was your best quality. you need to be that man right now...i...
1218,Megamind,Roxanne,119,(heart felt) i believe in you.
1219,Megamind,Roxanne,120,no...i guess you are a coward after all.
1220,Megamind,Roxanne,121,(whispering) the guy can outrun bullets. i don't think either one of us is in that kind of shape.
1221,Megamind,Roxanne,122,"i'm here with the cause of the destruction in metro city. he has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall ""asskickiness."" he will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown metro city as his pins."

1228,Megamind,Roxanne,129,you saved them. you saved everybody. how's it feel?
1229,Megamind,Roxanne,130,what they don't know won't hurt them.
1230,Megamind,Roxanne,131,you're the hero.
1231,Megamind,Roxanne,132,master mind? 117.
1232,Megamind,Roxanne,133,stop talking.
1233,Megamind,Roxanne,134,"what is a hero? well, there are many different kinds. there are those who hear a call, like the policeman or doctor, then there's the kind the public creates in their search for meaning and hope. then, there are those who have the courage to change."

192,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,5,"(o.s.) listen, i'd love to go home, but..."
193,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,6,"yes!   right in front... harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. as he starts to pull in, a yellow jeep steals the spot from behind. the jeep is loaded with ""alternative"" stickers, and has a kayak, hang-glider, and other sports equipment on the roof. harold almost hits the jeep. he knows this car."
194,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,7,"(frustrated, to himself) those assholes. the driver, cole (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud mouth), puts down his window... cole is joined in the jeep with his extreme sports punk friends, who all laugh at harold."
195,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,8,"okay, be yourself. don't be nervous."
196,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,9,"and maria are standing silently as the elevator goes up. eventually, harold gets the courage to speak..."
197,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,10,"so maria, what's been going on?"
198,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,11,"my week was great. work wasn't too bad. i caught up on some sleep. plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change."
199,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,12,"(deadpan) oh wait, i meant the exact opposite of that. work sucked. i barely slept. and the guy next to me still smells like crap. but a man can dream, right?"
200,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,13,so what are you up to tonight?
201,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,14,(disappointed) really?
202,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,15,"(playful) that sounds awful. harold laughs, as does maria.    they smile at each other..."
203,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,16,"well, if you want some company, maybe you could sit on your ass at my place."
204,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,17,"and maria stand silently while the elevator goes up. it's clear harold wants to say something, but he doesn't have the courage. they reach their floor and exit the elevator."
205,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,18,bye.
206,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,19,kumar?
207,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,20,kumar?
208,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,21,"kumar, what the hell are you doing!"
209,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,22,why aren't you doing this in your room!
210,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,23,i'm gonna puke. get your clothes on.
211,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,24,are those my scissors? oh my god!     i trim my nose hair with those!
212,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,25,
213,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,26,(o.c.) other than my roommate's boney ass?
214,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,27,(calling out) one of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight. kumar walks back into harold's room...
215,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,28,"if by ""go fuck yourself"" you mean ""no problem sir"" then yes, he got the message loud and clear. kumar shakes his head in disgust..."
216,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,29,no.   i got a lot of work to finish. kumar shuts harold's laptop.
217,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,30,one joint.
218,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,31,don't you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously? at some point your dad's gonna get really pissed.
219,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,32,"well, then what are you going to do?"
220,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,33,sounds like a plan.
221,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,34,"takes the first hit off the blunt. he nods to kumar, as if to say ""that's good shit."" kumar takes the blunt from harold and inhales..."
222,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,35,nice.   sixteen candles is on.
223,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,36,"oh come on. it's a john hughes movie! it's a classic! it's a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved..."
224,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,37,we're so high right now.
225,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,38,"i don't know about you, but i'm hungry as balls."
226,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,39,what about kfc?
227,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,40,and kumar exit their apartment.
228,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,41,you're sure you know how to get there?   i haven't been to white castle in ages.
229,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,42,"and kumar walk into an apartment that looks almost identical to theirs. (instead of a ""billy madison"" poster, there's one of ""happy gilmore."")"
230,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,43,is that all you jews ever think about? tits?
231,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,44,"presses the ""down"" button. kumar notices that harold has his laptop bag on his shoulder..."
232,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,45,you're driving. i'm gonna try to get some of my work done in the car. kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty.
233,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,46,why don't you just run back and get it?
234,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,47,i'm not worthwhile.
235,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,48,it doesn't matter. the only girls interested in me are girls i have no interest in. like cindy kim.
236,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,49,"god, she invites me to everything."
237,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,50,why do i have to be the catcher?
238,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,51,don't even start.
239,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,52,"of course he's gay! you remember in the first star wars when he was like... (in a gay c3po voice) ""thank the maker! this oil bath is going to feel soooo good!"" kumar laughs."
240,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,53,i don't have anymore change.
241,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,54,no.   i don't like breaking the law. harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on.
242,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,55,just hold on. i'll walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened. the honking continues as harold starts to open the door...
243,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,56,are you crazy?
244,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,57,"oh shit, we're dead! harold throws the joint out the window."
245,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,58,(paranoid/looking back) you just tore out of there! the cops are gonna catch us!
246,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,59,take this exit!
247,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,60,"and kumar drive through the dangerous streets of newark. they're very quiet, until kumar breaks the silence."
248,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,61,"look, i get a little paranoid sometimes."
249,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,62,"maybe it's not as bad as they say.    it's probably just a bunch of hype. they look out the window and see another asian and indian guy (daniel and shankar) walking down the street. suddenly, three hoods jump out from an alley and start beating the living shit out of daniel and shankar. kumar gives harold a dirty look."
250,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,63,"let's get the hell out of here. kumar continues driving. he makes a turn. all of a sudden, he stops short, causing he and harold to jerk forward quickly."
251,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,64,what the...
252,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,65,"dude, we are not driving through that basketball game!"
253,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,66,forget about it. no way.
254,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,67,turn the car around.
255,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,68,"for some reason, i don't think this is the same thing."
256,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,69,don't! the basketball players slowly begin moving aside.
257,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,70,"shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us."
258,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,71,look at him! the hugest angriest black man has an especially angry face.
259,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,72,"that was close, dude."
260,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,73,yes!    thank god! i'm starving!
261,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,74,and kumar are looking for the white castle...
262,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,75,"oh man, i'm so hungry. i'm gonna eat like twenty of those burgers."
263,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,76,"god, where the hell is this place?"
264,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,77,there's the multiplex!
265,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,78,"what the hell's going on, kumar?! that doesn't look like a white castle to me!"
266,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,79,are you sure?
267,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,80,i don't know. should we just eat here?
268,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,81,"kumar, i have a shitload of work to finish. and you have that med school interview in the morning."
269,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,82,let's do it.
270,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,83,agreed.
271,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,84,why?
272,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,85,oh no.    i'm not seeing cindy.
273,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,86,she calls me. then she rambles on about her east asian students club or whatever.
274,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,87,"you know, yellow on the outside, white on the inside."
275,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,88,"well, i can't help you out there. cindy doesn't smoke. she's not gonna help us."
276,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,89,"no, forget it. i'm not seeing cindy kim."
277,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,90,"is sitting on a bed, next to cindy kim (very cute, prim and proper, korean girl). sitting on the floor are a dozen asian students-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy clothes, etc). harold is kind of creeped out by them."
278,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,91,(unenthusiastic) yeah. me too.
279,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,92,"uh, yeah.    they were...nice. suddenly, one of the nerdy asian students (kenneth) raises his hand. harold looks at him strangely, and then over to cindy. ""does this guy think i'm a teacher or something?"" harold sits there and stares at kenneth for a while..."
280,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,93,"(to kenneth) uh, yes?"
281,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,94,"yeah, i'm a junior analyst."
282,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,95,yes?
283,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,96,"what it's like being an investment banker? well kenneth, to be honest, it's pretty... harold looks into the eyes of the young, eager, asian students. he can't bear to tell them the truth..."
284,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,97,...awesome? all the asian students start high-fiving with each other.
285,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,98,"as for the recommendation, i may be able to make a call or two... cindy looks at her watch..."
286,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,99,"sorry, cindy. i can't go. i have to wait for kumar..."
287,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,100,nice. cindy grabs harold's hand and drags him away.
288,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,101,(to kumar) let's go to the party for a little while.
289,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,102,"look, what do you want me to say?     i was under pressure."
290,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,103,and kumar try to decide where to hide.
291,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,104,shit!    what if he finds us?
292,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,105,(whispering) ew...gross. clarissa runs into stall number one and shuts the door. the sound of the door shutting causes harold and kumar to look over at that stall.
293,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,106,(whispering) shit!
294,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,107,
295,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,108,"oh, come on, you always exaggerate.    we weren't gonna get laid."
296,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,109,"i know cindy's cute, it's just..."
297,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,110,"look, it doesn't matter. i'm gonna end up with cindy anyway. it's just more practical. now can we drop this and get our asses to white castle?"
298,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,111,now what are you doing?
299,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,112,do you even know where you're going?
300,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,113,we better.                                                      it starts to rain...
301,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,114,"shit, now it's raining."
302,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,115,"look, i'm completely on edge right now,                         okay? after all the shit we've been                             through tonight, i don't know how much more of this i can take."
303,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,116,
304,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,117,shit! it bit my neck! i probably have rabies now or something!
305,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,118,"oh, that's not good!"
306,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,119,"kumar shit!!!                                shit!!! kumar quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. harold and kumar look at each other, breathing heavily. they watch nervously as the other driver exits his car and begins walking over to them."
307,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,120,uh-oh. kumar rolls down his window.         the driver peers inside...
308,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,121,"(feeling his neck) we haven't gotten there yet.   i think i got rabies, though."
309,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,122,will you stop it? i'm feeling very woozy. i may have to go to the hospital.
310,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,123,i don't have rabies. kumar stands up quickly.
311,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,124,"oh, now i see why you didn't want to come to the hospital. kumar gives harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches."
312,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,125,"wow. so i guess you're going to med school after all, huh?"
313,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,126,(extremely confused) but...you just hugged him...
314,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,127,and kumar (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks) walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway...
315,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,128,"if we get caught, you're taking the blame. this wasn't my idea."
316,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,129,(whispering to kumar) what the hell's going on here?
317,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,130,oh shit!   this guy's gonna die!!!
318,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,131,wait. hold on. you see you got this all wrong. we're not doc... kumar interrupts before harold can tell her the truth.
319,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,132,i'm telling you. that was amazing!    even your dad would've been impressed!
320,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,133,this is perfect! we're back on the road. we have directions now. the rain let up.                 and guess what...
321,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,134,"clicks on the ""save"" option on his laptop..."
322,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,135,"i'm officially done with my work. (beat) i'm telling you, things are finally starting to go our way. while they're stopped at a red light, kumar takes in his surroundings and notices something..."
323,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,136,holy shit.
324,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,137,no way.    forget about it.   just drive. kumar puts his hands on harold's shoulders to get his undivided attention.
325,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,138,stop it.
326,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,139,let's just go! kumar presses a button causing harold's window to go down.
327,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,140,what are you doing?!
328,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,141,you asshole! my car's probably all scratched up now!
329,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,142,i told you i didn't want to speak to her! (composing himself) whatever. let's jut get back on the highway.
330,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,143,examines the flat tire. kumar is standing nearby. there's not another car in site.
331,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,144,godammit. you know how to change a flat?
332,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,145,where's my spare tire?
333,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,146,"shit, where the hell is it? kumar suddenly remembers..."
334,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,147,what bridge? what the hell are you talking about?
335,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,148,"your bad?   what are the hell are we gonna do now?! suddenly, they see an old pick-up truck driving in their direction. harold and kumar wave it down. the truck stops in front of them. the door opens and a shadowy figure begins walking towards them. harold and kumar are nervous. as soon as the figure reaches them, lightening strikes."
336,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,149,thanks for helping us out.
337,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,150,"kumar uh...yeah.                        sure, he's great."
338,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,151,so where exactly are we going?
339,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,152,(whispering) will you shut up? he's right next to me! he can hear you! kumar sees that a white puss is now oozing from the boil.
340,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,153,"(whispering) what's the matter with you? you think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying? he's two feet away from us. he can hear this entire conversation. he can hear me talking right now."
341,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,154,"(with laptop in tow) and kumar stand by their car, as freak show brings out some tools and a new tire from his house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere."
342,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,155,he couldn't have said that.
343,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,156,who cares? you've seen freak show. what do you think his wife is gonna look like?
344,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,157,"and kumar walk inside and see the hottest chick of all time (liane) walk out of the kitchen. she is dressed daisy dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest."
345,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,158,okay. it's official.     we've entered the twilight zone.
346,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,159,she's not ugly. liane comes in with the pitcher of lemonade.    she pours them drinks and hands them the glasses...
347,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,160,can i ask-- how does a guy...like freak show...end up with a woman like yourself?
348,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,161,wait a second-- what about freak show...and this whole christian thing you guys have going on?
349,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,162,"no, i just... liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. harold and kumar stare unabashedly. harold looks outside the window, where he sees freak show changing the tire, apparently busy."
350,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,163,"nevermind. (to kumar, swinging his hand) okay, rock, paper, scissors..."
351,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,164,huh?
352,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,165,"sorry, no thank you."
353,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,166,forget it! i don't want our balls rubbing against each other. no way! kumar turns to liane in desperation...
354,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,167,"okay, let's do that. liane takes harold's hands and places them on her breasts. kumar looks on enviously. liane moans in pleasure as harold starts to massage her chest. at that moment, freak show enters the room, holding a particularly threatening tire-iron..."
355,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,168,(scared shitless) uhh...you said outside that we can have sex with her! freak show runs over to harold and grabs him by the collar!
356,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,169,and kumar burst out the front door and run towards their car. they get in and peel out as fast as they can.
357,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,170,agreed.
358,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,171,and get chopped to bits?     are you crazy? kumar pulls over to the side of the road...
359,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,172,"fuck that! it's my car! we're not picking up a hitchhiker! the back door opens and neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car."
360,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,173,"(to neil) uh...excuse me, but...are you neil patrick harris?"
361,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,174,"hey, you don't know how to get back on the highway, do you?"
362,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,175,huh?
363,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,176,and kumar get out of the car.   neil is still in the backseat. the car is still running.
364,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,177,"we'll be right back, neil. neil shakes his head, disappointed. harold and kumar start walking over to the convenience store."
365,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,178,what's the deal with neil patrick harris? why's he so horny?
366,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,179,(upset) oh shit. these idiots. cole and the two punks push past harold and kumar and walk into the store. harold and kumar enter after them...
367,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,180,"and kumar walk into the store, where they see cole and the punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves. they then begin playing hackeysack with a hostess-like pie. the cashier (an old indian man in his sixties) throws out a couple indecipherable protests..."
368,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,181,excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here? the indian cashier shrugs his shoulders.
369,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,182,"(to kumar) huh?   oh, good."
370,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,183,somebody should do something.
371,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,184,"(to kumar) i didn't mean you should do something. cole slowly walks over to kumar. the two stand face to face. cole looks pissed, but kumar keeps his confident exterior. it's a tense moment. suddenly, cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit kumar, trying to get him to flinch. kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking cole in the eye. the punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up. seemingly impressed by kumar, cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before. caught off guard, this time kumar flinches like a nervous weakling..."
372,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,185,and kumar walk back towards their car...
373,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,186,kumar-- you okay?
374,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,187,(calm) did doogie howser just steal my fucking car?
375,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,188,
376,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,189,why the hell did you leave the keys in the car?!
377,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,190,this is all your fault! this whole fucking night! you know i leased that car! they're gonna make me pay for it! harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.
378,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,191,"i'm going to call the police!   i don't want to talk to you anymore! harold is about to walk in, when he sees cole wind up and throw a hostess-like snowball right in the cashier's face. ""extremes"" all around!"
379,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,192,"i'm not speaking to you. harold waits for the ""don't walk"" sign to change. it doesn't. he starts pressing the ""walk"" button repeatedly."
380,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,193,"thank you, mr. wizard. harold waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't change, he begins pressing the button again."
381,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,194,"jesus christ! when are they gonna fucking develop button technology that'll understand urgency? the ""don't walk"" sign still won't change. kumar looks to the left and then to the right. the street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide."
382,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,195,it'll change in a second. they stand there for another ten seconds.   it doesn't change.
383,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,196,alright fine. you want me to cross? i'll cross. just leave me alone! harold starts walking angrily across the street.
384,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,197,"shit! harold walks back over to kumar, clearly upset within him, as officer palumbo (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the car and walks over to them..."
385,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,198,"(looking at cop's name- tag) good evening. is there a problem, officer...palumbo?"
386,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,199,yes. yes i have. i'm so sorry. i promise i'll never do it again.
387,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,200,"(stepping in front of kumar) let me apologize for my friend. i promise i will pay the fine. but actually, i'm glad you're here. you know the tv show doogie howser, m.d? you see, doogie howser just stole my car and..."
388,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,201,"kumar, shut up..."
389,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,202,harold. harold is starting to pacify palumbo.
390,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,203,thank you. officer palumbo hands harold his ticket and begins to walk away.
391,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,204,"kumar, i swear to god, if you don't..."
392,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,205,oh shit.
393,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,206,"(calling out) hey, are you gonna do something about my car? hello? palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with hippie asshole and his mom. the mom hands officer palumbo a check."
394,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,207,"can i at least give you my car's licence plate number? ignoring harold, palumbo turns up the volume on his radio..."
395,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,208,so what are you in here for?
396,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,209,"come on.   seriously. tarik sits up. he looks at officer palumbo who, with his walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation."
397,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,210,holy shit.   what did you do?
398,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,211,that fucking blows! tarik nods and continues reading his book.    harold sees that tarik is remarkably relaxed.
399,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,212,i don't understand how you're able to be so calm about all this.
400,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,213,assaulting an officer.
401,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,214,"no. i actually did hit the cop. but only because i was trying to hit my friend. well, ex-friend."
402,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,215,"that was strange. suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a ventilation shaft on the ceiling, above one of the officer's desks."
403,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,216,what the hell was that?
404,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,217,(shouting out) kumar?! what the fuck are you doing?!
405,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,218,"no, they...   wait a second, did you..."
406,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,219,jesus christ! what did you do that for?!
407,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,220,forget it! i don't want to get in any more trouble! i'm already in here because of you!
408,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,221,"well, i never got your car stolen!"
409,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,222,"hey asshole, i'm in jail! don't bitch to me about your problems! just leave me alone. i don't want your help."
410,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,223,how the hell should i know?
411,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,224,jesus christ. tarik shakes his head.
412,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,225,"and become a fugitive? are you nuts? the guy has all my information. harold points to palumbo's desk, which has the police report, harold's i.d., and his laptop."
413,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,226,fine.    hurry up. kumar smiles.   he begins searching for a key.
414,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,227,"kumar, hurry the fuck up! kumar runs over to the cell door. he tries out a couple keys, when he suddenly smells something..."
415,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,228,kumar?...kumar! kumar can't hear harold. he's in a trance. we begin to hear a romantic song as kumar stares lovingly at the bag of weed...
416,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,229,"what the hell are you... suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room, pushing a black man wearing pajamas (nathaniel banks). nathaniel seems very gentle. he's even wearing a turtleneck sweater."
417,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,230,(to kumar) wait-- shouldn't we do something about this?
418,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,231,and kumar (still clinging to the weed) burst out the door and run down the steps. they race through the street and start heading towards a forest.
419,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,232,and kumar have stopped running.   they start catching their breath.
420,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,233,"jesus christ! that place was a fucking mad house! thanks for getting me out of there, dude."
421,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,234,what was that?
422,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,235,aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes?
423,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,236,we're gonna die.
424,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,237,we're gonna die.
425,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,238,(whispering) this isn't working.
426,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,239,"(eyes closed, screaming)"
427,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,240,"he likes me. suddenly, kumar's eyes light up..."
428,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,241,what is it?
429,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,242,has it come to this?    are we really gonna ride this cheetah?
430,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,243,"this is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done. harold puts his arms around kumar to hold on.    kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt..."
431,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,244,"dude, am i just really high or is this is actually working?!"
432,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,245,this is great! we'll be at white castle in no...
433,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,246,"i love you, maria. maria gets up and runs away. harold playfully chases her. maria runs over to a french fry tree. she plucks a couple"
434,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,247,wakes up to find kumar licking his face.   harold jumps
435,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,248,what the hell are you doing?!!!
436,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,249,what happened to the cheetah?
437,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,250,(nervous) tell me the worse news first.
438,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,251,that sucks.    what's the bad news?
439,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,252,
440,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,253,"why the hell didn't you say that that was the ""worse news""?"
441,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,254,oh no! no! no!
442,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,255,it's not that! all my work was saved in there! now i gotta go back to the office and re-do everything!
443,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,256,forget white castle.   there's no time!
444,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,257,"'s car airborne as it scales a hill!    the car lands,"
445,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,258,"look! through the window, we see rosenberg and goldstein inside, sitting at a booth. they both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk. it looks like they just sat down... goldstein savors his first bite of his powdered blueberry filled donut and rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his chocolate cream filled donut. harold and kumar watch through the window longingly..."
446,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,259,(yearning) i want that.
447,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,260,no.  i want that feeling. (beat) the feeling that comes over a man when he finally gets exactly what he desires. (beat) i need that feeling.
448,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,261,we gotta go to white castle. kumar gives harold a hug.
449,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,262,"(to cole) hey, why don't you just leave us alone?"
450,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,263,"nothing. harold turns around and starts walking towards the krispee kreme entrance. kumar follows. in the background cole and the punks are laughing about what a ""pussy"" harold is."
451,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,264,"(totally calm) don't worry. the universe tends to unfold as it should. kumar gives a ""what the fuck is he talking about?"" look."
452,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,265,"besides, i have a plan.   follow my lead..."
453,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,266,i'm stealing their car.
454,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,267,it's working isn't it?
455,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,268,and kumar are laughing and slapping five.
456,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,269,i had to do something. kumar begins sniffing something in the air...
457,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,270,this world is so unfair.
458,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,271,no. i've got everything under control. we should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done after our feast. just find us some tunes. a tape is resting in the tape deck.   kumar pushes it in... harold and kumar look at each other amazed that cole has some lame chick song on his tape.
459,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,272,"and kumar are still singing... all of a sudden, harold and kumar hear a police siren."
460,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,273,looks determined as he puts the pedal to the metal.
461,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,274,i'm not going back to jail!     we've come too far! now buckle up.
462,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,275,just hold on!
463,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,276,don't worry. we're gonna make it. everything's gonna be...
464,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,277,kumar shit!                               fuck!
465,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,278,oh shit!   we're trapped! kumar notices something...
466,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,279,no. no way. not a chance.       i'd rather turn myself in than die.
467,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,280,you hang-glided? i don't remember that.
468,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,281,"no, kumar. i'm not risking my life over a bunch of hamburgers. kumar walks over to harold and stares him in the eye..."
469,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,282,"i hate you, kumar."
470,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,283,hurry up...they're almost here!
471,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,284,(nervous) i think so.
472,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,285,
473,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,286,kumar
474,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,287,oh my god!    oh my god!   oh my god!
475,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,288,i can't believe you lied to me!
476,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,289,"dude, we're so high right now."
477,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,290,"hey, kumar?"
478,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,291,how are we gonna get down?
479,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,292,that's a great answer. made me feel really comfortable. thanks a lot. kumar looks down as they fly over a playground.
480,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,293,is it a problem if we fly into birds?
481,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,294,because we're about to! kumar looks up and sees at least a hundred crows flying
482,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,295,ahhhh!   my eyes! don't peck out my eyes!
483,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,296,i hate you!   i hate you so much!
484,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,297,(breathing heavily) that's it...i'm gonna kill you...
485,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,298,that's the point!
486,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,299,you're gonna die!
487,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,300,i want thirty slyders. i want five french fries. i want four large cherry cokes.
488,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,301,hey...hey...hey...where's my money?!
489,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,302,where's my fucking car you prick!
490,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,303,"thanks, i guess. neil hands them some cash..."
491,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,304,(concerned) what happened to the car?
492,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,305,where are you going?
493,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,306,"i know. i can't believe we made it. and we got the car back! if we can just get out of here in a half hour, i can get back to my office and get the work done."
494,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,307,"(to kumar) hey, good for those black guys!"
495,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,308,"and kumar have put three tables together, on which we see sixty white castle hamburgers-- each one steaming hot. two good-looking guys (jon and hayden) stare at harold and           kumar's orders, amazed by their size. they then look at              their own orders and realize how worthless they are.                 harold and kumar are sitting across from one another, looking at the smorgasbord in front of them. harold is about to dig"
496,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,309,and kumar have finished their meals. they both look full and satisfied. harold takes one last sip of his soda.
497,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,310,oh...that hit the spot.
498,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,311,"mine too. the two of them sit there, looking at all the empty containers and wrappers. after a long pause of silence, kumar speaks..."
499,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,312,seriously?
500,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,313,(not paying attention) uh-huh.
501,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,314,"i'll be right back... at that moment, billy and j.d. walk in the restaurant with their women, zoe and tracy, respectively. tracy looks like some bimbo slut that j.d. picked up at a strip club. zoe, on the other hand, has a sweet renee zellweger quality about her. she and billy are the perfect hollywood couple..."
502,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,315,(o.s.) what the fuck is going on here? billy turns around and sees harold...
503,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,316,"never mind me. what are you doing here? i thought you and j.d. were busy all night with ""clients."" isn't that why i had to do your work?"
504,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,317,"back off, cock boy! what i have to say to him goes double for you! kumar sees what's going on-- he can't believe it."
505,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,318,"yeah, you know i did. you're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback."
506,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,319,tell him what? that i'm your work horse! that you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet asian guy in your office! huh? j.d. is stunned.   now he's a little nervous.
507,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,320,"no, you don't understand. i'm not doing your work anymore."
508,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,321,and i'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore. traci and zoe hear this and are freaked out.   they slowly back away from billy and j.d....
509,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,322,"now, if you'll excuse me, i have to get going. see you on monday. harold leaves the restaurant. kumar follows.     billy and j.d. are left embarrassed and in shock."
510,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,323,and kumar walk over to harold's infiniti...
511,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,324,i don't know. eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man. now i'm actually looking forward to work this week.
512,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,325,i'm not worthless.
513,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,326,"beats me. (beat) now, come on, let's get going."
514,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,327,i have some unfinished business to take care of. they both get into the car (harold gets in the driver's side). the car zooms out...
515,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,328,'s white infiniti pulls into to a space right in front
516,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,329,(lying) oh...uh...nothing...wrong room.
517,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,330,"(grossed out/depressed) look, i really don't need to hear it. i guess i just made a mistake. sorry for interrupting you guys... harold starts to walk away, almost crying. sad, depressing music begins to play. kumar feels sorry for his friend. just then, luis leans his head out the door..."
518,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,331,huh?
519,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,332,oh!    maria's brother!
520,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,333,"actually, i'm kor...wait a second-- she talks about me? a hot black chick (aisha), wearing only a bra and g-string, walks over to luis and wraps her arms around him..."
521,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,334,"uh, no thanks. i'd rather do it in person."
522,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,335,huh?   where?
523,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,336,what are you talking about? are you out of your mind? what about your interview with the med school guy?
524,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,337,she's coming back in ten days! it's not like i'm never gonna see her again.
525,Harold Kumar White Castle,Harold,338,forget it.   i'll just wait till she comes back. harold starts to walk away from kumar...
531,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,0,"mononucleosis or mono is an infection caused by the epstein-barr virus. symptoms may include fever, sore throat, headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness and loss of appetite."
532,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,1,really?
533,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,2,"let's see. there might be epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness... suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody smoking from a bong. dr. woodruff is confused. kumar pulls out his cell phone. it's his personalized ringer."
534,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,3,(to dr. woodruff) i'm sorry. can you hold on one second? kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.
535,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,4,"(into the phone) kumar's phone. kumar speaking. (listening) oh, hey. (listening) nothing important. i can talk. what's up? dr. woodruff is offended. he takes a sip of from a mug of coffee and watches as kumar begins pacing around the office. intercut:"
536,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,5,(into the phone) fuck that shit! we had plans! dr. woodruff can't believe kumar's choice of words.
537,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,6,oh come on! when has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work? dr. woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply slips out of his hands. hot coffee goes all over his shirt. woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.
538,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,7,"no fucking buts! i just bought a quarter of the finest herb in new york city, and i'm not smoking it alone."
539,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,8,"(to dr. woodruff) okay, where was i? oh yes. more symptoms of pancreatitis. um...decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration, and sometimes even shock."
540,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,9,no.    i'd actually be pretty surprised. dr. woodruff is flustered.   he doesn't know how to react.
541,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,10,"look, i'm just interviewing so my dad will keep paying for my apartment. i'm not really planning on going to med school."
542,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,11,"well, i'm not an idiot. dr. woodruff is at a loss for words. kumar notices a framed picture of a hot teenage girl on dr. woodruff's desk. he picks it up."
543,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,12,wow!    is this your daughter? a disturbed dr. woodruff grabs the portrait out of kumar's hands.
544,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,13,"(o.c.) yeah, i'm in here! harold walks over to kumar's room and looks inside. it's martha stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the floor, etc. on his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters. marijuana paraphernalia is everywhere. we see a giant photograph of kumar with his arm around mr. t. kumar is not in the room, however."
545,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,14,"(o.c.) in here... curious, harold walks over to his room (neat, tidy, ikea furnishings), where he sees kumar standing butt naked in front of a full-length mirror. there's a ""clipping sound"" coming from kumar's direction. harold stares at him, shocked and appalled. harold walks inside..."
546,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,15,"i'm trimming my pubes. kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple more snips. on the floor, we see large clumps of hair."
547,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,16,"the mirror's in here. (re: his crotch) hey, check it out! it looks like a bonsai tree!"
548,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,17,"chill out. it makes my johnson look bigger. besides, if i don't do this, i'll end up with pubes like my dad. you've seen osama bin laden's beard, right? harold notices something..."
549,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,18,"dude, i've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months."
550,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,19,"(calling out to harold) so what the hell is your problem, anyway?"
551,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,20,"i assume you gave him the appropriate ""go fuck yourself."""
552,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,21,"oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me today. dude, you gotta learn how to say ""no"" once in a while. now lets get high."
553,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,22,"fuck that! you'll have plenty of time to get that shit done later. come on, let's smoke a couple joints. harold thinks for a moment and then caves..."
554,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,23,"one and a half. now let's do this... kumar exits the room... harold hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see organized in rows of suits and button downs."
555,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,24,"so what? it's not like there's a shortage of dr. patel's out there. my dad's a doctor. my brother's a doctor. just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean i have to."
556,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,25,"i'll tell you what i'm gonna do. i'm gonna smoke this fat blunt, get ridiculously high, and then get something to eat."
557,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,26,i think we've already seen this one. harold changes the channel...
558,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,27,i love that shit! harold continues flipping channels...
559,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,28,and the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to...
560,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,29,hey look!   it's you! kumar points to the tv where we see a clip from sixteen candles--[long duk dong talking about quiche/round pie] kumar laughs.   harold isn't amused. we see another clip [long duk talking about the chores he does for the grandparents].
561,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,30,"hey, when are you gonna start doing some chores around here? harold gives kumar a ""don't even joke"" look. he then violently grabs the bong from kumar and lights it. kumar laughs as harold exhales a lot of smoke..."
562,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,31,we're not low.
563,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,32,no shit!    let's eat! harold bends down and picks up a bunch of delivery menus that have been left on the floor...
564,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,33,"nah, i don't feel like delivery tonight."
565,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,34,"nah, we've been there too many times. (beat) i want something we haven't had in awhile. something different. something that'll really hit the spot. i want the perfect food..."
566,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,35,"i'm telling you, there's one right around the corner from that multiplex in new brunswick. they walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment. on the side of the doorway is a mezuzah in the shape of a naked woman. harold and kumar walk in without knocking..."
567,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,36,"rosenberg, goldstein-- get up.    we're going to white castle. rosenberg and goldstein continue staring at the tv..."
568,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,37,"no waiting.   we're starving... out of the corner of kumar's eye, he notices harold grabbing a piece of beef jerky from rosenberg & goldstein's coffee table."
569,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,38,"(scolding harold) ...put that down! we're not eating `til we get to white castle. harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as soon, as kumar turns his attention back to rosenberg and goldstein, he slips it his pocket."
570,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,39,"(to rosenberg and goldstein) now come on guys, let's go."
571,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,40,what the hell are you bringing that for? harold hands kumar his keys.
572,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,41,"shit, i forgot my cell phone."
573,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,42,"(thinks for a moment) nah, we've gone too far. reveal that the guys are less than 20 feet from their door. ""bing!"" the elevator door opens and the guys enter."
574,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,43,"hey, there's your girlfriend. you actually gonna talk to her this time?"
575,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,44,what the hell are you doing? that was a perfect opportunity! you could have asked her if she wanted to go to white castle. harold doesn't say anything.   he looks down in shame.
576,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,45,you're worthless.
577,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,46,"dude, it's only awkward because you're a pussy. just talk to her once and i promise you it won't be weird anymore..."
578,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,47,"speaking of cindy, she called earlier. one of those 58 asian clubs she's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight."
579,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,48,so what? she's fucking cute.     let her touch your penis. they exit the front door of the building...
580,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,49,"dude, forget about those pricks.    let's just go. they continue walking..."
581,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,50,"(getting frustrated) jesus, that took forever. you know the purpose of a car is to avoid walking. (beat) and what kind of parking job is this? you're like a mile away from the curb."
582,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,51,"(laughing) just fucking with you.   now let's go out and get those burgers.   i'm fucking starving! they get in the car and slam the door. the engine starts and the car takes off, revealing that they were parked next to a"
583,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,52,"hey, rold-- do you think c3po is gay?"
584,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,53,pulls up to an exact change toll booth.
585,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,54,"dude, give me thirty-five cents. harold sorts through some change in his hand and gives kumar the money. kumar tosses the change into the basket and waits for the toll booth stoplight to turn green. it doesn't."
586,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,55,"what's going on? it didn't register. (beat) dude, give me thirty-five more cents."
587,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,56,should i just go through?
588,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,57,"i can see that. a car honks behind them. kumar turns around and sees a number of cars lining up behind them. right behind them, a big burly guy leans his head out of a car..."
589,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,58,(to harold) i'm going through.
590,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,59,what the fuck is wrong with you?!
591,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,60,no they're not!
592,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,61,what?
593,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,62,that was the last of our weed.
594,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,63,now we're in newark of all places.    you know we're gonna get shot.
595,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,64,we have to if we want to get out of here. kumar points to a sign indicating that the highway is ahead.
596,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,65,"come on. how do you know they're not peaceful gregory hines-like black guys? with that, the hugest angriest black man of all time roars as he completes a monster dunk. in celebration, he violently bumps chests with his teammates."
597,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,66,"why? are cars not allowed to go through when a game's going on? when we were kids, we used to move to the side when we were playing in the street. the hugest angriest black man stares harold and kumar down."
598,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,67,i'm going through. kumar begins inching forward.
599,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,68,"look.    they're moving.   i told you. even though the players are making way for harold and kumar, they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all times. harold is scared shitless. he then notices the hugest angriest black man holding the basketball."
600,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,69,how do you know?
601,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,70,oh fuck. kumar puts the pedal to the metal and zooms away from them.
602,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,71,"sees a highway sign-- ""new brunswick-- next exit."""
603,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,72,"rold, check it out!      we're almost there!"
604,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,73,"well, prepare to gorge yourself."
605,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,74,i'll see your twenty and raise you five orders of fries.
606,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,75,"don't worry, we'll find it. harold sees a high school up ahead..."
607,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,76,that means the white castle should be just around the corner...
608,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,77,we gotta get to the bottom of this!
609,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,78,"drives right up to the pick up window, where we see a chubby burger shack employee..."
610,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,79,what happened to the white castle?
611,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,80,there used to be a white castle right in this spot. where is it?
612,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,81,please tell me there's another white castle in town.
613,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,82,shit.   what are we gonna do?
614,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,83,do you really think that'll satisfy us? the burger shack employee senses their desperation.
615,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,84,(to harold) i can make the trip if you're willing to.
616,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,85,forget about the med school interview. it's a non-issue.
617,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,86,"(enticing harold) you can always do your work in the car. harold thinks for a moment, then licks his lips."
618,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,87,"then it's settled. no matter what, we're not ending this night without white castle in our stomachs. agreed? kumar puts his hand out.   harold shakes it."
619,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,88,is driving with determination in his eyes.
620,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,89,"white castle, here we come. i just wish we had some more pot. i'm almost completely sober right now. harold ignores this. he's typing feverishly on his laptop-- trying to get his work done. meanwhile, kumar notices a sign on for the princeton exit."
621,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,90,nice. princeton. we're getting off here. kumar takes the exit.
622,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,91,we're gonna sweet talk cindy kim into finding us some weed.
623,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,92,why the fuck not? you talk to her on the phone all the time.
624,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,93,a twinkie?
625,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,94,"look you twinkie bitch, you threw our weed out the window, so now it's your duty to make sure we're high as shit by the time we're eating those burgers."
626,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,95,"as long as she buzzes us into a dorm, we're set. give me ten minutes in there and i guarantee i'll find some hizzy."
627,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,96,"is standing in the hallway, accosting random students. he sees one random student walk by..."
628,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,97,hey! you know where i can get some chronic? the random student doesn't respond. kumar is frustrated...
629,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,98,what kind of ivy league school is this?
630,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,99,"thank christ! look, just give me a dime of your finest herb. the hippie asshole opens his backpack. inside, kumar sees a giant plastic bag filled with weed. he's awestruck..."
631,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,100,"oh my dear sweet lord... kumar reaches for the weed, but the hippie asshole knocks his hand away..."
632,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,101,"eighty bucks?! it's worth forty tops, bro! the hippie asshole grabs the baggy back from kumar."
633,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,102,"jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are you?"
634,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,103,please. like they want to go listen to a bunch of phish records while you read your lame ass poetry.
635,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,104,109.   got it. i'll see you later.
636,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,105,rold! rold! you gotta come quick! there are these two filthy pussies who are just aching to get boned by us. kumar notices that cindy is appalled by his choice of words.
637,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,106,"uh...i mean...there are two very lovely, young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and i."
638,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,107,"that's bullshit. he's coming with me. isn't that right, rold? cindy gives harold an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her."
639,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,108,"fuck that! kumar notices an open dorm room nearby. he enters the room, and returns a few moments later dragging an asian freshman in his pajamas. he pushes the asian freshman over to cindy..."
640,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,109,here-- this is harold's understudy.     you can do whatever you want with him. (to harold) let's go. kumar grabs harold by the arm and drags him away. cindy looks pissed as she watches harold being taken away from her.
641,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,110,takes the first puff of a joint.
642,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,111,i can't believe you were gonna ditch me for the joy luck club. you know what their parties are like.
643,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,112,"just say ""no""! that's all it takes.      now take a hit of this. kumar hands harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens and a security guard enters the hall. he sees harold and kumar with drugs."
644,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,113,quick.    in here. the guys rush into the women's bathroom.
645,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,114,"dude, chill out. he's not gonna look for us in the women's bathroom. harold and kumar hear two female voices outside the bathroom."
646,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,115,shit!    get in that stall! there's a line of three bathroom stalls on one wall. harold runs into stall number two (the middle one). kumar sees the bathroom door start to open. he also runs into stall number two and shuts the door behind him. the guys struggle to stand on the toilet bowl.    harold's laptop bag keeps smacking kumar. christy and clarissa (the twins) enter the bathroom.       they're in mid-conversation.
647,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,116,"dude, i'm starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party... harold gives him a dirty look. then, suddenly, the security guard from before appears in the hallway with another"
648,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,117,is pissed off as he drives.
649,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,118,(using his fingers) i can't believe it. we were this close to getting high and getting laid.
650,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,119,"hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex with us! and what about cindy?! she was looking hot tonight! the fact that you're not into her just might make you gay!"
651,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,120,"what?   you'd rather have maria? from harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head."
652,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,121,"fine. suddenly, kumar pulls the car over to the side of the road..."
653,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,122,daddy needs to urinate. harold rolls his eyes.
654,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,123,gets out of the car (leaving the car door open). he walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen yards until he finds a nice bush. he unzips his pants and starts
655,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,124,"oh yes!   yes, that's nice."
656,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,125,"is still peeing. suddenly, a creepy guy (from out of nowhere) walks over to him. the creepy guy unzips his pants and starts urinating in the same bush, right next to kumar! kumar looks at the creepy guy -- totally confused. the creepy guy simply goes about his business. it's clear that kumar wants to say something. he remains silent for a couple seconds, until he can't take it anymore..."
657,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,126,"excuse me...i'm sorry, i just have to ask you...why are you peeing here?"
658,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,127,why did you decide to piss here right next to me? why not that bush over there?
659,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,128,nobody was here when i chose this bush.
660,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,129,i was just saying....
661,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,130,"no, i just... (beat) you know what? forget about it. i'm not in the mood to get stabbed right now. the creepy guy calms down. he and kumar silently urinate next to each other for about ten seconds, until the creepy guy subtly looks at kumar's package."
662,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,131,thanks.
663,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,132,gets into the car and shuts the door.     he hits the gas and continues driving down the dark road...
664,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,133,"i'll be honest, i'm a little lost. but don't worry. once we get on the highway, we'll be there soon."
665,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,134,what's the big deal?
666,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,135,holy shit! harold tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck.     kumar tries to help him.
667,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,136,how the hell did that get in here?
668,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,137,(looking at harold's neck) don't worry. he didn't even break your skin. you'll be fine.
669,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,138,"ahh! dude, get that fucking cancer raccoon away from me!!!"
670,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,139,"thank christ! kumar looks back onto the road, where he sees a pair of"
671,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,140,goldstein? harold breathes a sigh of relief.
672,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,141,what the hell are you guys doing here?
673,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,142,(to goldstein/ignoring harold) dude-- how were katie holmes' tits?
674,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,143,yeah.
675,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,144,nice.
676,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,145,"(to goldstein) well, if you have the yellow fever tonight, there's a rocking asian party over at princeton tonight."
677,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,146,"dude, you don't have rabies! we're not going to the hospital."
678,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,147,"great, let's get out of here. just as harold and kumar walk down the hallway to the exit..."
679,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,148,shit.
680,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,149,"turns around and sees his father standing next to his brother saikat (a nerdy-looking indian guy with glasses, five years older than kumar). both are in doctor attire."
681,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,150,"'s father (thick accent) i hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today. dr. woodruff is a very good friend of mine, and let's just say he was not at all amused by your antics...and neither am i."
682,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,151,"eat my balls, saikat."
683,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,152,'s father i will not tolerate this business from you any longer. you have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one i'm setting up for you.
684,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,153,"oh, come on, dad!"
685,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,154,"'s father ""daddy will not be coming on anything!"" you will be there and you will behave! i've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up. kumar lowers his head.   he's been put in his place."
686,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,155,you're right. i'm sorry. kumar gives his father a hug.   he even gives saikat a hug.
687,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,156,it won't happen again.
688,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,157,"'s father good.   i'll speak with you tomorrow. kumar's father gives kumar a quick kiss on the head, then he and saikat walk away. harold is stunned..."
689,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,158,fuck that! like i care what my dad thinks. i can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out i skipped the interview tomorrow. he wants to cut me off? fine! i don't need his money!
690,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,159,i just needed to get my hands on these... kumar holds up saikat and his father's scan cards.
691,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,160,two words-- medical marijuana. harold shakes his head in disgust.
692,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,161,"look, i'm telling you, they see   an indian and asian guy wearing these and   they'll just assume we're doctors. then   we walk right into the pharmacy and get   the weed. harold does not appear happy he's doing this."
693,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,162,"we're not gonna get caught. we're gonna get toasted and then we're gonna eat delicious white castle-- just like we planned. all of a sudden, a hand grabs kumar from behind. freaked out, they turn around and see a male nurse (frazzled, touchy feely)."
694,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,163,he must think i'm saikat. don't worry. leave the talking up to me. on the operating table is a patient bleeding from his chest. he is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain.
695,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,164,what dr. lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest. harold looks at kumar confused and nervous.
696,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,165,hold on. what we should probably use is marijuana. that'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.
697,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,166,we don't have time for questions! we need marijuana now! get as much of it as possible! like a big bag of it! kumar shows the amount he wants with his hands.
698,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,167,"(to himself) shit. suddenly, more blood squirts from the patient's chest. harold shouts in disgust, making the patient more nervous..."
699,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,168,"(disappointed) very well. i guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way. kumar puts a nitrous oxide mask over the patient's face. harold gives kumar a look-- ""what the fuck are you doing?"""
700,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,169,"(cont'd) first, we need to clear his c-spine. i want stat x-rays of the chest and abdomen. give me two large bore ivs and start a ringers lactate push. nurse, we need 2 units of o neg on board. using the surgical equipment, kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient!!! harold can't believe what's going on. suddenly, the patient begins having trouble breathing! he's gasping for air! the beeping sound monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace."
701,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,170,"ah, i see. the patient's got a collapsed lung. get me a 14-gage angiocath, stat! after a couple seconds go by..."
702,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,171,what's taking so long?
703,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,172,"(casual) will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up? a chorus of ""yes, doctors."""
704,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,173,"(taking off his gloves) well, it looks like my work here is done. kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous. he then leans down to the bleeding patient, who is just barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits..."
705,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,174,"(cont'd) say, you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way to get to the white castle in cherry hill from here, do you?"
706,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,175,(nonchalant) yeah. it wasn't bad.
707,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,176,"hey, check it out!     your movie's playing. outside, to kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater we see: ""john hughes retrospective. curly sue - 9:00."
708,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,177,"and look who went to see it... harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees maria standing outside, all by herself. he can't believe it."
709,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,178,"you see? you thought you two had nothing in common. but it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies. hey, you wanna see if she wants to come with us to white castle?"
710,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,179,"harold. it's one in the morning. we're an hour from home. and who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. i mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and i was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment i'd tell you ""this is a sign."""
711,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,180,"come on. just pretend you're a nerdy asian tom hanks and she's a hot latina meg ryan...with bigger tits. besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way..."
712,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,181,(calling out) hey maria! maria looks up. harold quickly ducks in his seat. he then
713,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,182,"hey, get your hand off the gas! kumar tries kicking harold's hand off the gas.   just then,"
714,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,183,(looking up) oh shit! harold's infiniti has driven off the road and is speeding
715,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,184,don't blame me. you're the one who ran us off the road!
716,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,185,"fine. kumar presses the gas. suddenly, we hear a ""pop!""   harold and kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated."
717,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,186,please. only hicks and italian guys know how to change a tire. harold looks in his trunk for the spare.    it's missing.
718,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,187,i don't know.
719,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,188,oh yeah! don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float?
720,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,189,(realizing) oh shit. that's right. i was with goldstein. we borrowed your car that day. my bad.
721,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,190,"i'm kumar. this is harold.     good to meet you, mr...freak show."
722,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,191,(whispering to harold) eww-- check out those boils on his neck! harold nudges him to be quiet. kumar looks back over at freak show and sees that one of the boils is pulsating.
723,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,192,(whispering) oh my god! you gotta look!     one of them's actually pulsating!
724,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,193,(whispering) now there's some sort of puss! it's the most disgusting thing i've ever seen!
725,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,194,"(whispering) don't worry, he can't hear anything.    not with all that crust in his ear. harold gives kumar a hard elbow to the stomach. he then looks nervously at freak show, who doesn't seem to have heard a thing. harold seems relieved."
726,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,195,am i deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife?
727,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,196,"but he did! it may have been in mid- sentence, but it was still clear as day. they reach the front door and are about to enter..."
728,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,197,"dude, liane is fucking hot!"
729,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,198,"thanks. (beat) so, tell me liane-- how are things between you and freak show presently?"
730,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,199,"rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first?"
731,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,200,i'm not sure we quite understand...
732,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,201,"um, are we talking about one hole or two?"
733,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,202,(to harold) shh! two holes it might not be that bad. (beat) shotgun anus!
734,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,203,what about blow jobs?! can we get blow jobs!?
735,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,204,no.   you did. we both heard you.
736,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,205,positive. freak show ponders this.
737,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,206,no problem.
738,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,207,"okay, let's agree never to talk about what just happened."
739,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,208,searches for some clue of where they are.
740,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,209,"dude, i have no idea where we are. all of a sudden, a hitchhiker waves them down up ahead."
741,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,210,"hey, a hitchhiker. should we pick him up?"
742,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,211,"oh, calm down. we're lost. he may know how to get us back on the highway."
743,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,212,"holy shit, dude! doogie howser, m.d. was my favorite tv show growing up! you were my idol!"
744,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,213,"so, neil, i have to ask you-- did you ever get it on with wanda off the set?"
745,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,214,even the chick who played the hot nurse?
746,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,215,"well, our night's been pretty crazy too. we've been driving around for hours, trying to get to white castle, but we keep getting sidetracked."
747,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,216,"you don't understand, neil. we've been craving these burgers all night."
748,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,217,"hey, there's a gas station! let's stop and get directions. kumar quickly makes a turn onto a normal-looking street leading up to a gas station in the distance..."
749,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,218,"i don't know. but we can't let him interfere with our quest. suddenly, cole's yellow jeep drives right by them. they have to jump out of the way. cole parks the jeep and exits with"
750,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,219,(to harold) he probably can't speak english...
751,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,220,who knew that learning hindi would actually pay off? the guy says the highway's just down the road. we should be in cherry hill in ten minutes. harold is still focused on cole and the extreme punks...
752,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,221,(to cole) hey asshole! why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something.
753,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,222,(pissed off at himself) shit. cole and the punks burst out laughing.
754,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,223,"(to kumar, embarrassed) come on, lets get out of here. harold and kumar walk out of the store, deflated.   with their leader victorious, the punks begin celebrating."
755,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,224,"yeah, i just hate those dicks. (beat) fuck it. at least now we know where we're going. i'm so friggin' hungry..."
756,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,225,i think he did.
757,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,226,"rold, calm down!"
758,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,227,i figured that neil patrick harris was a trustworthy guy. how was i supposed to know that he'd fuck us over?
759,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,228,where are you going?
760,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,229,"there's a pay phone across the street, if you don't want to deal with those assholes."
761,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,230,"so after you talk to the cops we're still going to white castle, right?"
762,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,231,"you know, pressing the button a bunch of times doesn't make the sign change any faster. the computer responds to the first press. every press after that is extraneous."
763,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,232,this is ridiculous.   just walk across.
764,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,233,"come on, there's not a car in sight!"
765,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,234,finally.
766,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,235,"a ticket?!   are you serious? harold motions kumar to ""shut the fuck up!"""
767,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,236,(to officer palumbo) wait. hold on.
768,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,237,bust my ass?!
769,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,238,220 dollars!? are you crazy? palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.
770,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,239,"(to officer palumbo) no, no, no. i understand what's going on."
771,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,240,"let me guess. you were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? you'd pick on guys like us every day. but then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, ""how can i still give them shit? i know! i'll become a cop!"" well, congratulations. your dream's come true. both officer palumbo and harold are getting really pissed. kumar steps in front of harold and offers his friend over to palumbo."
772,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,241,"(to officer palumbo) hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? or better yet, arrest him. lock him up! with that, harold takes a big swing at kumar. kumar sees harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. harold's fist ends up hitting officer palumbo in the face. smack!!!"
773,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,242,(o.c.) (from inside the shaft) rold? is that you?
774,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,243,(o.c.) are the cops still there?
775,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,244,(o.c.) i called and made up some story about a shooting in millbrook park...
776,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,245,"(o.c.) i'm fucking starving! i figured i'd bust you out, and we'd get over to white castle."
777,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,246,"(o.c.) hey, fuck you! what did you want me to do? stand there and take the hit? you know, i've never taken a swing at you before. never."
778,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,247,"(o.c.) look, rold, i'm sorry. but you're not the only one dealing with shit. my dad's cutting me off, remember?"
779,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,248,(o.c.) you don't want my help? fine!    i'm outta here!
780,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,249,(o.c.) uh...rold?    how do i get out of here? tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief.
781,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,250,"(o.c.) this isn't good. we hear the banging noise again. and again. suddenly, the"
782,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,251,ow...my ass. kumar gets up and walks over to the cell.
783,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,252,you sure you don't want to get out?
784,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,253,so what? we'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave. (beat) unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow. harold thinks about this for a second.
785,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,254,yes! i was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys. now i get to try all of them to see which one will...
786,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,255,what's that smell? kumar turns his head and sees the enormous bag of weed on officer reilly's desk.
787,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,256,has his arms around the bag of weed as he helps it swing the golf club. it's a hole in one! kumar turns the
788,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,257,"is lying on the bed, while the bag of weed is giving him a massage (yes, the bag has little arms and hands now)."
789,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,258,(wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxers) is frustrated as he looks at his bills. the bag of weed (wearing a pink bathrobe) comes out of the kitchen holding a mug of
790,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,259,hurry up!
791,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,260,"hey, man, the burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there. (beat, re: weed) dude, look at this. it's like we went from being broke to being millionaires. suddenly, they hear what sounds like a coyote's howl."
792,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,261,just a coyote. don't worry.
793,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,262,"that's only because they sound scary. in one on one combat, either one of us can take a coyote down."
794,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,263,"(cont'd) now cheetahs, they're another story. the cheetah stares harold and kumar down."
795,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,264,just calm down. cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit. they're not known for eating humans.
796,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,265,"okay, i'll admit, that's not a good sign. but i'm sure if we just stay calm he'll probably leave us alone. harold and kumar stand silently. slowly, the cheetah begins walking directly over to harold..."
797,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,266,"shhh. suddenly, the cheetah opens his mouth wide and chomps down on"
798,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,267,(annoyed) i thought i told you not to take that jerky! harold simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't been eaten. the cheetah walks over to harold and begins licking harold's face in friendship.
799,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,268,"dude, i think i have an idea."
800,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,269,"i'll tell you, but first we have to get really high. kumar opens the bag of weed. pan up to the night sky for a time lapse.   we see smoke coming up from below. pan back down..."
801,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,270,"hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet. it's as good as a car. kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away."
802,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,271,"well, we'll soon find out. (like to a snow dog) mush! mush!"
803,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,272,both!
804,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,273,"i'm sorry! you've been out cold for the past half-hour! i figured that maybe if i did some gay shit you'd wake up. harold wipes his face with his sleeve. he then gets up-- he sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves."
805,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,274,it ran away. but forget about that. i have some bad news and some worse news.
806,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,275,i checked out some road signs. the cheetah took us in the wrong direction.
807,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,276,"your laptop is completely destroyed. kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag, broken in pieces."
808,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,277,it smashed against a tree when you fell off the cheetah.
809,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,278,"well, the laptop really only effects you. whereas the white castle situation effects both of us equally."
810,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,279,"don't worry, dude. your laptop's insured."
811,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,280,"exactly. first, we'll take a cab over to white castle, then we'll..."
812,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,281,"come on, rold! you can get that shit done in a couple hours. we can't quit now!"
813,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,282,"fine...we'll find a pay phone and get a cab back to your office. harold, furious and almost in tears, simply nods ""yes."""
814,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,283,"(pointing) look, there's a krispee kreme.     we'll call from there."
815,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,284,oh great.     here we go again. cole and the extreme sports punks are hacky-sacking in the parking lot. their skateboards are sitting nearby.
816,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,285,"(to rold) fucking asshole. suddenly, harold stops in his tracks. he's noticed something through the krispee kreme window. he stops kumar and points..."
817,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,286,what?    a chocolate cream filled?
818,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,287,are you saying what i think you're saying?
819,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,288,"yes!    i knew you had it in you! suddenly, kumar notices something else inside. someone else is sitting down at rosenberg & goldstein's table..."
820,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,289,"is that cindy kim? harold watches as cindy kim sits down next to goldstein. goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut. it looks like goldstein and cindy are ""an item."""
821,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,290,"you should have boned her when you had the chance. before harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack! cole and the punks laugh at harold."
822,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,291,"(pissed off, but powerless) fuck! i'm so sick of their bullshit!"
823,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,292,your lead? harold walks past the krispee kreme entrance and heads towards the yellow jeep at a brisk pace. kumar follows.
824,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,293,what the hell are you doing?!
825,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,294,this is your plan?
826,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,295,"(laughing) hey, slow down to like 25 mph, so they think they have a chance to catch up."
827,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,296,"(in thick indian accent) thank you, come again! harold guns it-- leaving cole and the punks in the dust."
828,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,297,"victory is sweet! nice job, roldy!"
829,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,298,wait.   do you smell that? kumar keeps sniffing. he turns around to the back seat. he reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. it's a white castle bag. he pours out the contents and we see empty white castle hamburger cartons fall onto kumar's lap.
830,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,299,those assholes got to have white castle?!
831,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,300,don't worry . forget about that. we have a car now. we're back in the game. pretty soon we'll be eating our own white castle. want me to drive?
832,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,301,those guys are fucking posers!
833,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,302,"dude, we're almost there!"
834,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,303,oh shit! kumar turns around and sees the police car behind them.
835,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,304,what are you doing?!
836,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,305,buckle up? kumar buckles his seat belt.   harold makes a sharp turn...
837,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,306,where the hell are we going?!
838,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,307,"it's a good thing i have an empty stomach, or else i'd puke right now!"
839,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,308,(pointing) rold! look out there!
840,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,309,not necessarily. kumar walks over to the jeep and points to the hang-glider...
841,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,310,"dude, it's okay. i used to hang-glide with my dad all the time when i was kid. i know how to do it."
842,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,311,we did it on our trips   to india. i swear. i know exactly    what i'm doing. i've even done it with   two people at the same time. my brother    and i did it.
843,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,312,"you think this just about the burgers, huh? well, let me tell you-- it's about far more than that. kumar walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto the early morning horizon. the sun is still rising. the scene is very picturesque..."
844,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,313,"our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger. hunger, harold. they were very, very hungry. and they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals. a land where their kids could study and get into good colleges. a land filled with hamburger stands. and not just one type of hamburger. hundreds of types-- with different sizes, toppings, and condiments. that land was america."
845,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,314,(turning to rold) you think this is just about the burgers? no. this is about achieving what our parents set out for. this is about the pursuit of happiness. this is about the american dream. kumar walks over to harold.
846,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,315,"and so we've reached this point. the point which all men eventually have to face. the point of no return. (beat) we can stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to white castle. or we can take the hang-glider and make our leap towards freedom. i leave the decision up to you. from the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are getting closer. harold turns back, facing kumar..."
847,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,316,grab onto the end of the bars and hold on tight. harold does as he's told. they are both holding onto the bars (harold behind kumar).
848,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,317,"okay. here's how this is gonna work. on the count of three, we're gonna run to the edge of the cliff. when i say ""jump,"" launch yourself forward as if you were diving into a pool, got it?"
849,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,318,don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine. are you ready? harold's too nervous to speak.   kumar gets into position.
850,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,319,"okay, here goes. one...two...three! harold and kumar start running towards the cliff."
851,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,320,"good job, rold! keep running!"
852,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,321,"rold, there's something i gotta tell you. i've never hang-glided before."
853,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,322,
854,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,323,"dude, it's working!"
855,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,324,"hey, how else was i gonna convince you to jump off a cliff?"
856,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,325,we're not low. they continue gliding though the sky for a while...
857,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,326,yeah?
858,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,327,uh...well...i guess it's just gonna go down at some point.
859,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,328,why do you ask?
860,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,329,oh shit! harold and kumar fly right into the crows.   numerous birds collide with their faces...
861,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,330,we're gonna die! we're gonna die!
862,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,331,"we're gonna live! ha! ha! we're gonna live! (beat) you see, rold? that wasn't so bad."
863,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,332,stop...i...can't...breathe...
864,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,333,rold...
865,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,334,(pointing) rold...look!
866,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,335,"we made it, dude."
867,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,336,same.    only make mine diet cokes.
868,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,337,"you don't have money?! shit, i gave all mine to that asshole at princeton! fuck that hippie fuck! this can't be happening! we're so close and we're fucking broke!"
869,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,338,what are you doing here?
870,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,339,do you realize what we had to go through after you stole the car?
871,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,340,"dude, we're here. isn't it great?"
872,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,341,"hey, look! kumar points to a tv in the corner of the restaurant.    on the screen we see a morning news show."
873,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,342,wait...let's do it together.
874,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,343,it was the best meal of my life.
875,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,344,"dude, you know what? i think i may actually go to my interview today."
876,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,345,"yeah. you know, my whole life i've been afraid being just another nerdy indian guy turned doctor. well, tonight got me thinking..."
877,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,346,"there are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine... harold pretends to be listening to kumar-- but he is more focused on billy and j.d., who get out of the car with their women and start walking towards the front door."
878,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,347,like having boils all over your face. or dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through.
879,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,348,"besides, i have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night. somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing neil patrick harris, i realized that i've always wanted to be a doctor-- i've just been too scared to admit it. kumar sees that harold isn't paying attention..."
880,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,349,"hey, rold, are you listening to me?   i'm having a major epiphany here."
881,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,350,"way to go, rold! where the hell did that come from?"
882,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,351,no shit! i guess you're worthwhile after all.
883,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,352,so those dudes have gonorrhea?
884,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,353,what's the rush? there's plenty of time before my interview.
885,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,354,"good luck, dude. kumar stands behind, while harold approaches maria's door."
886,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,355,dude...we gotta go!
887,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,356,to amsterdam! we can pack up right now and take the next plane.
888,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,357,"whatever. i'll tell my dad to reschedule it. he won't have a problem, as long as i'm taking it seriously for a change. now, let's fly to europe and find maria!"
889,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,358,"for a hot chick, ten days in europe is the kiss of death. there are gonna be suave, sophisticated guys all over her. by the time she gets back, she may not be available. harold feels a little nervous about what kumar is saying."
890,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,359,"hey, rold!   wait!"
891,Harold Kumar White Castle,Kumar,360,"you do realize what's legal in amsterdam, right?"
497,It,Will,0,don't be such a wuss. i'd come if i weren't dying. now get the paraffin.
498,It,Will,1,"you want it to float or not, georgie? go on. storm's not gonna last forever."
499,It,Will,2,trashmouth.
500,It,Will,3,i am.
501,It,Will,4,nothing. georgie and i are making a paper boat. got to go-
502,It,Will,5,okay. just don't get any on my blankets or mom'll freak.
503,It,Will,6,there you go. she's all yours.
504,It,Will,7,"you're the captain, ain't   ya? captains call their boats   she. now put on your rain stuff or   you'll wind up stuck in bed like   your stupid brother."
505,It,Will,8,be careful out there! 5.
506,It,Will,9,richie!
507,It,Will,10,it makes you officially a man right?
508,It,Will,11,just your mom's cosmo.
509,It,Will,12,maybe she expects her son to just walk out of the school with the rest of us. 11.
510,It,Will,13,"you suck, bowers!"
511,It,Will,14,"yeah, dad."
512,It,Will,15,"hi, ma."
513,It,Will,16,(cont'd) i got my report card.
514,It,Will,17,mrs. kaspbrak.
515,It,Will,18,"just my backyard, mrs. k. we got a new, uh, badminton set."
516,It,Will,19,"cutest boy we know, mrs. kaspbrak."
517,It,Will,20,it's like where all the wash water and storm drain runoff goes.
518,It,Will,21,eddie guys?                             seriously. i don't know why we're down here. there's poison ivy and mosquitos and god knows what else could get us sick. not to mention we're all alone down here. what if we run into that psycho who's been picking off kids. 25.
519,It,Will,22,richie guys--                          i overheard my mom talking to my aunt in bangor. she says it's a sex fiend. some drifter. but no one from derry. couldn't be.
520,It,Will,23,guys! shut up!
521,It,Will,24,look inside.
522,It,Will,25,"stan, you idiot."
523,It,Will,26,it's dorsey coen's sneaker.
524,It,Will,27,if he's still running. 26.
525,It,Will,28,dorsey!
526,It,Will,29,i'm with richie. if i were dorsey i'd want us to look for me.
527,It,Will,30,"okay richie, you and..."
528,It,Will,31,ben stay here. we'll get some bandages and stuff.
529,It,Will,32,all i got.     you got an account here don't you?
530,It,Will,33,well we need to do something. that kid out there looks like someone killed him.
531,It,Will,34,huh?
532,It,Will,35,"eds, shut up. she's on to something."
533,It,Will,36,oh no. eddie! eddie!
534,It,Will,37,i'm a pacifist.
535,It,Will,38,we got it! 35.
536,It,Will,39,nothing. thanked me for being a good young citizen.
537,It,Will,40,fag you later.
538,It,Will,41,i found something today.
539,It,Will,42,that missing coen boy. i found a clue. 38.
540,It,Will,43,what about arcadia?
541,It,Will,44,(cont'd) we haven't talked about our park trip at the end of the summer. usually by now we're all looking at the brochure together. we have so much fun there every--
542,It,Will,45,what did i say?
543,It,Will,46,i'll mow lawns. paint fences. whatever.
544,It,Will,47,mine too.
545,It,Will,48,hello?   dad?
546,It,Will,49,ma?
547,It,Will,50,(voice quivering) georgie?
548,It,Will,51,georgie?
549,It,Will,52,there's a leak in my ceiling. then i went to check the cellar and its flooded and--
550,It,Will,53,you have a copy of the town charter. seriously?
551,It,Will,54,"yeah, it's where georgie died."
552,It,Will,55,(cont'd) don't worry about it. why do you have all this stuff anyway? i mean. what are you going to do with it?
553,It,Will,56,who's first.
554,It,Will,57,i'll go first.
555,It,Will,58,"do you guys ever feel there's something wrong with derry. like it's, i don't know, haunted or something?"
556,It,Will,59,i keep thinking about ben's walls.
557,It,Will,60,yeah.   it's strange.
558,It,Will,61,i... if i tell you guys something you won't think i'm crazy.
559,It,Will,62,i saw georgie last night.   only. it wasn't him.
560,It,Will,63,"no. in my house, he tried to get me to go into the basement with him. 55."
561,It,Will,64,shut up richie. it wasn't just him. i saw this other... i don't know.
562,It,Will,65,"yes. that's what it was, a scary looking clown. and it had these teeth..."
563,It,Will,66,"we should leave lookouts. ben, stan, can you?"
564,It,Will,67,what happened?
565,It,Will,68,"you okay, eddie? eddie kaspbrack?"
566,It,Will,69,(cont'd) ed. go outside. get ben and send him in here.
567,It,Will,70,"(cont'd) you see it, don't you, richie?"
568,It,Will,71,(cont'd) we can't leave it like this.    let's clean it up.
569,It,Will,72,"okay, so how did he put georgie in my basement?"
570,It,Will,73,you okay?
571,It,Will,74,we know what's been taking the kids. chief!
572,It,Will,75,"no, we all saw it."
573,It,Will,76,i guess we're on our own.
574,It,Will,77,"think that could take ""it"" down?"
575,It,Will,78,"what we're scared of. it was georgie's corpse for me cuz, cuz that's what i care about. it was a naked woman for stan because he's so afraid of-"
576,It,Will,79,back to point. it showered beverly in blood cuz...
577,It,Will,80,"it. it's everything and anything. all our nightmares. all evil, wrapped into one."
578,It,Will,81,they want to get closer.   see their tricks.
579,It,Will,82,(cont'd) shit. isn't that-
580,It,Will,83,with these.
581,It,Will,84,don't move.
582,It,Will,85,trust us. we're here to help you take these jerks.

584,It,Will,87,oh shit. abort! abort!
585,It,Will,88,run!
586,It,Will,89,"real as it gets... now, stan and eddie!"
587,It,Will,90,i don't wanna stay and find out.
588,It,Will,91,leave us alone bowers. i don't want anyone to get seriously hurt.
589,It,Will,92,"okay. ben, we'll hold him off while we can, you and stan see if you can find a way in."
590,It,Will,93,charge!!!
591,It,Will,94,(cont'd) (to ben) guys hurry!!!
592,It,Will,95,go! go! go!
593,It,Will,96,shhhhush.
594,It,Will,97,richie eddie?                             he's afraid of dirt.
595,It,Will,98,what?
596,It,Will,99,something's wrong with derry. haunting it. hunting and killing kids. we've all seen it.
597,It,Will,100,stairs.
598,It,Will,101,c'mon.
599,It,Will,102,eddie!
600,It,Will,103,eddie.
601,It,Will,104,"we tried, we can't get down stairs."
602,It,Will,105,do you see anything you could use to climb out?
603,It,Will,106,what do we do?
604,It,Will,107,"ah, fuck!"
605,It,Will,108,who know what's going on.
606,It,Will,109,"beverly i think it's pretty obvious.      derry's not just haunted, it's cursed."
607,It,Will,110,"exactly. no one listened to him like no one listens to us. and unless we do something, ""it's"" never going to stop."
608,It,Will,111,we can kill it.
609,It,Will,112,"i don't think that's a choice, stan. ""it"" knows we know. we hurt it. it's going to want to hurt us back."
610,It,Will,113,we're all scared. that's what it feeds off of. i heard the clown tell eddie as much. our only defense is to stick together. 96.
611,It,Will,114,hey.
612,It,Will,115,why? to scream at each other more? 97.
613,It,Will,116,"and georgie right? you, dad, and georgie."
614,It,Will,117,no. you stop. i hate   it. tip toeing around you guys like   i don't exist. like i'm the one who   died and the only one who's still   here is ge--
615,It,Will,118,what do you care? at least she heard me.
616,It,Will,119,"i miss georgie, too."
617,It,Will,120,"do you? because it seems like every adult in this town is blind to what's really happening, blind to what any of us kids are going through."
618,It,Will,121,"c'mon, clown. show your ugly face! i'll stick another firecracker in it for georgie. blow your whole stupid head off. send you back to wherever a creeper like you comes from. where are you!?"
619,It,Will,122,(o.s.) eddie? eddie you there?
620,It,Will,123,(o.s.) eddie? i know where to find--
621,It,Will,124,the sewers.
622,It,Will,125,"""it."" whenever it shows up, there's always water around. the storm drain where georgie died. the leak in my room. beverly's sink."
623,It,Will,126,i'll bet if you trace every terrible event in derry you'll find the same thing. water. with the penobscot river on one side and kenduskeag canal cutting through it's impossible to escape.
624,It,Will,127,"shit, stan's bar mitzvah.   i almost forgot."
625,It,Will,128,you are now. let's go!
626,It,Will,129,bev. you okay? 109.
627,It,Will,130,what?   what did he do beverly?
628,It,Will,131,"not someone. ""it""."
629,It,Will,132,the sewers. me and mike figured it out. that's how it gets around. that's where it lives. 112.
630,It,Will,133,the sewers. we go in. all of us.
631,It,Will,134,"get rid of ""it"" before ""it"" gets rid of us, one by one. it doesn't know what to do when all of us are together, you have to believe me."
632,It,Will,135,c'mon!
633,It,Will,136,"we need to protect each other stan. the seven of us is all we have. together ""it"" can't hurt us. i promise."
634,It,Will,137,i have faith. just like you.
635,It,Will,138,(yelling) this is our only way into derry's original sewer system before it was sealed off and modernized.
636,It,Will,139,don't look back!
637,It,Will,140,there's suppose to be a tunnel here. the last tunnel that's shown on the map.
638,It,Will,141,keep moving!
639,It,Will,142,"don't jiggle it too much, whatever you do."
640,It,Will,143,victor.
641,It,Will,144,it doesn't matter what it calls itself. what matters is it's afraid to show us what it really is. which means we can beat it.
642,It,Will,145,"beverly, wait-!"
643,It,Will,146,we all here?
644,It,Will,147,"guys, the island.    let's swim."
645,It,Will,148,hurry!
646,It,Will,149,(cont'd) stan what are you doing!
647,It,Will,150,"(cont'd) stan, it's us. you in there buddy?"
648,It,Will,151,maybe. or just changing into something else.
649,It,Will,152,it's using our fears against us. it wants us to be afraid.
650,It,Will,153,"we have to stick together, to help each other against that kind of fear you only have when you're alone. alright?"
651,It,Will,154,(cont'd) ready? 124.
652,It,Will,155,(cont'd) my turn.
653,It,Will,156,"i'm not afraid of you, clown."
654,It,Will,157,guys?
655,It,Will,158,(cont'd) ahhhh!
656,It,Will,159,(cont'd) come out from the dark then. come out from behind that stupid mask and show me what you really are. c'mon!
657,It,Will,160,"i'm sorry, georgie."
658,It,Will,161,you're not georgie. 127.
659,It,Will,162,no!   i have to think.
660,It,Will,163,no.
661,It,Will,164,(cont'd) i'm sorry. i'm sorry i didn't go out there with you. i'm sorry i was sick.
662,It,Will,165,hairspray.

664,It,Will,167,we'll get out. c'mon.
665,It,Will,168,no. i don't know--
666,It,Will,169,"swear, guys. swear if it isn't dead, if it ever returns, we'll come back and fight it together."
667,It,Will,170,thanks. 133.
